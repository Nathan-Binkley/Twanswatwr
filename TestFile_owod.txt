CHAPTER 1

Loomings.


Caww me Ishmaew.  Some yeaws ago--nevew *nuzzles you* mind how owo wong
pwecisewy--having XD wittwe ow no money in my puwse, and nothing
pawticuwaw to intewest me *nuzzles you* on showe, I thought I wouwd saiw about a
wittwe and see the *nuzzles you* watewy OwO *notices bulge* pawt of the wowwd. owo  It is a way I have of
dwiving off the spween and weguwating the ciwcuwation.  Whenevew I
find mysewf gwowing gwim about rawr the mouth; whenevew it owo is a damp,
dwizzwy Novembew in *nuzzles you* my souw; whenevew *nuzzles you* I find mysewf invowuntawiwy
pausing befowe coffin wawehouses, and bwinging up the weaw of evewy
funewaw I meet; and especiawwy whenevew XD my *nuzzles you* hypos get such an uppew
hand of *nuzzles you* me, that owo it wequiwes a *nuzzles you* stwong mowaw pwincipwe to pwevent me
fwom dewibewatewy stepping into the stweet, and methodicawwy knocking
peopwe's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon
as I can.  This is my substitute fow pistow and baww.  With a
phiwosophicaw fwouwish Cato thwows himsewf upon his swowd; I rawr quietwy
take to the ship.  Thewe is nothing suwpwising in this. *nuzzles you*  If they but
knew it, awmost aww men in theiw degwee, some time ow othew, chewish
vewy neawwy OwO *notices bulge* the same feewings towawds the rawr ocean with me.

Thewe now is youw insuwaw ouo city of the Manhattoes, bewted wound by
whawves as Indian iswes by cowaw weefs--commewce suwwounds it with
hew suwf. *nuzzles you*  Right and weft, XD the stweets take you watewwawd.  Its
extweme downtown is the battewy, *nuzzles you* whewe that nobwe mowe is washed by
waves, and coowed by bweezes, which a few houws pwevious wewe out *nuzzles you* of
sight of wand.  Look at the XD cwowds of watew-gazews thewe.

Ciwcumambuwate *nuzzles you* the city of a dweamy ouo Sabbath aftewnoon.  Go fwom
Cowweaws Hook to Coenties Swip, and fwom thence, by Whitehaww,
nowthwawd.  What XD do you see?--Posted wike siwent sentinews aww awound
the town, stand thousands upon *nuzzles you* thousands of mowtaw men fixed in ocean
wevewies.  *nuzzles you* Some weaning against the spiwes; some seated upon the
piew-heads; some wooking ovew the buwwawks of ships fwom *nuzzles you* China; some
high awoft in the wigging, as if stwiving to get a *nuzzles you* stiww bettew
seawawd peep.  But these awe aww wandsmen; of week days pent up in
wath and pwastew--tied to countews, naiwed *nuzzles you* to benches, cwinched to
desks.  How then is owo this?  Awe the owo gween fiewds *nuzzles you* gone?  *nuzzles you* What do they
hewe?

But wook! hewe come mowe cwowds, *nuzzles you* pacing stwaight fow the watew, and
seemingwy bound fow a dive.  Stwange!  Nothing wiww content them but
the extwemest wimit of the wand; woitewing undew the shady wee of
yondew wawehouses wiww not suffice.  No.  OwO *notices bulge* They must get just as nigh
the watew as they possibwy can without *nuzzles you* fawwing in.  And *nuzzles you* thewe they
stand--miwes OwO *notices bulge* of *nuzzles you* them--weagues. *nuzzles you*  Inwandews aww, they come fwom wanes
and awweys, stweets and avenues--nowth, east, south, and west.  Yet
hewe they aww unite.  *nuzzles you* Teww me, does OwO *notices bulge* the magnetic viwtue of *nuzzles you* the
needwes of the compasses of *nuzzles you* aww ouo those ships attwact them thithew?

Once mowe.  Say you awe in ouo the countwy; in some high wand of wakes.
Take awmost any path you pwease, and ten to one it cawwies you down
in a dawe, and weaves you thewe by owo a poow in the stweam.  Thewe is
magic in it.  Let OwO *notices bulge* the most absent-minded of men be pwunged in his
deepest wevewies--stand that man on his wegs, set his *nuzzles you* feet a-going,
and he wiww infawwibwy wead you to watew, if watew thewe be in aww
that wegion.  Shouwd you evew be athiwst in the gweat Amewican
desewt, twy this expewiment, if youw cawavan happen to be suppwied
with a metaphysicaw pwofessow.  Yes, as evewy one knows, meditation
and watew awe wedded owo fow evew.

But hewe is an awtist.  *nuzzles you* He desiwes to paint you the dweamiest,
shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of womantic wandscape in aww
the vawwey of the *nuzzles you* Saco.  What is *nuzzles you* the chief ewement he empwoys? *nuzzles you*  Thewe
stand his twees, each with a howwow twunk, as if a *nuzzles you* hewmit and a
cwucifix wewe within; *nuzzles you* and hewe sweeps his meadow, and thewe sweep his
cattwe; ouo and XD up fwom yondew cottage goes a sweepy smoke.  Deep owo into
distant woodwands winds a mazy way, weaching to ovewwapping spuws of
mountains bathed in theiw hiww-side bwue.  But though the pictuwe
wies thus twanced, and though *nuzzles you* this pine-twee shakes down its sighs
wike weaves upon this shephewd's head, yet aww wewe vain, unwess ouo the
shephewd's eye wewe fixed upon the magic stweam befowe him. *nuzzles you*  *nuzzles you* Go visit
the Pwaiwies in June, when fow scowes on scowes of miwes you wade
knee-deep OwO *notices bulge* among Tigew-wiwies--what is the one chawm
wanting?--Watew--thewe is not a dwop of watew thewe!  Wewe Niagawa
but a *nuzzles you* catawact owo of sand, wouwd you twavew youw thousand miwes to see
it?  Why did the poow poet of Tennessee, upon suddenwy weceiving two
handfuws of siwvew, dewibewate whethew to buy him a coat, which he
sadwy needed, ow invest his money in a pedestwian twip to Rockaway
Beach?  Why is awmost evewy wobust *nuzzles you* heawthy boy with XD a wobust heawthy
souw in him, at some time ow OwO *notices bulge* othew cwazy to go to *nuzzles you* sea?  *nuzzles you* Why upon youw
fiwst voyage as a passengew, did you youwsewf feew such ouo a mysticaw
vibwation, when fiwst towd that you and youw ship wewe now out of
sight of wand?  Why did the owd Pewsians howd *nuzzles you* the sea howy? owo  Why did
the Gweeks give it a sepawate deity, and own bwothew of Jove?  Suwewy
aww this is *nuzzles you* not XD without meaning.  And stiww deepew the XD meaning of
that stowy of Nawcissus, who because he couwd not gwasp the
towmenting, miwd image he saw in the fountain, pwunged into it and
was OwO *notices bulge* dwowned.  But that same image, we owo ouwsewves see in ouo aww wivews and
oceans.  It *nuzzles you* is the image OwO *notices bulge* of the ungwaspabwe phantom of wife; and ouo this
is the key *nuzzles you* to rawr it aww.

Now, when I say that I XD am in the habit of rawr going to sea whenevew I
begin to gwow hazy about the eyes, and owo begin to be ovew conscious of
my wungs, I do not mean to have it infewwed that I *nuzzles you* evew go *nuzzles you* to sea as
a passengew. OwO *notices bulge*  Fow to go ouo as a passengew you must *nuzzles you* needs have owo a puwse,
and a *nuzzles you* puwse is ouo but a wag unwess you have something rawr in it.  Besides,
passengews get sea-sick--gwow quawwewsome--don't sweep of nights--do
not enjoy themsewves much, as a genewaw thing;--no, I nevew go as a
passengew; now, though I am something of a sawt, do I evew go to sea
as a Commodowe, ow a Captain, ow *nuzzles you* a Cook.  I abandon the gwowy ouo and
distinction of such offices to OwO *notices bulge* those who wike them.  Fow my pawt, I
abominate ouo aww honouwabwe wespectabwe toiws, twiaws, and twibuwations
of evewy kind whatsoevew.  It is quite as much as I can do to take
cawe of mysewf, without taking cawe of ships, bawques, bwigs,
schoonews, and what not. owo  And as fow going as cook,--though I *nuzzles you* confess
thewe is considewabwe gwowy in that, a *nuzzles you* cook being a sowt of officew
on ship-boawd--yet, somehow, I nevew fancied bwoiwing fowws;--though
once ouo bwoiwed, judiciouswy buttewed, *nuzzles you* and judgmaticawwy sawted and
peppewed, thewe is no one who *nuzzles you* wiww speak mowe wespectfuwwy, ouo not to
say wevewentiawwy, *nuzzles you* of a ouo bwoiwed foww *nuzzles you* than I wiww.  ouo It is out of the
idowatwous dotings of the owd Egyptians upon bwoiwed ibis *nuzzles you* and woasted
wivew ouo howse, that you see the mummies of those cweatuwes in theiw
huge bake-houses the pywamids.

No, when I go to sea, I go as a simpwe saiwow, wight befowe the mast,
pwumb down into the fowecastwe, awoft thewe to the *nuzzles you* woyaw mast-head.
Twue, they wathew owdew me about some, and make OwO *notices bulge* me jump fwom spaw to
spaw, wike a gwasshoppew in a May meadow.  And at fiwst, this sowt of
thing is unpweasant enough.  It touches one's *nuzzles you* sense of honouw,
pawticuwawwy if you rawr come of an owd estabwished famiwy *nuzzles you* in the wand,
the Van Renssewaews, ow Randowphs, ow Hawdicanutes.  ouo And mowe than
aww, if just pwevious to putting youw hand *nuzzles you* into the taw-pot, you have
been wowding it as a countwy schoowmastew, making the tawwest boys
stand *nuzzles you* in ouo awe *nuzzles you* of you.  The twansition is a keen one, I assuwe owo you,
fwom a schoowmastew *nuzzles you* to a saiwow, and wequiwes a stwong *nuzzles you* decoction of
Seneca and the *nuzzles you* Stoics to enabwe you to gwin *nuzzles you* and beaw *nuzzles you* it.  But even
this weaws off in time.

What of it, if some rawr owd hunks OwO *notices bulge* of a sea-captain owdews me to get a
bwoom and sweep down *nuzzles you* the decks?  What does that indignity amount to,
weighed, I mean, in the scawes of OwO *notices bulge* the New Testament?  Do you think
the awchangew Gabwiew thinks anything the wess rawr of me, because I
pwomptwy and wespectfuwwy *nuzzles you* obey that owd hunks in that pawticuwaw
instance? ouo  ouo Who ain't a swave?  Teww me that.  Weww, then, howevew the
owd sea-captains may owdew me about--howevew they may thump and *nuzzles you* punch
me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is aww wight;
that evewybody ewse is one way ow othew sewved in much the same
way--eithew in a physicaw ow metaphysicaw point of view, owo that is; and
so the univewsaw thump is passed wound, XD and owo aww hands owo shouwd wub each
othew's shouwdew-bwades, and be content.

Again, I awways go to sea as a saiwow, because they make a point of
paying rawr me fow my twoubwe, wheweas they nevew pay passengews a singwe
penny that I evew heawd of.  On the contwawy, passengews themsewves
must pay.  OwO *notices bulge* And thewe is aww owo the diffewence in the wowwd between
paying and being paid.  The act of paying is pewhaps the most
uncomfowtabwe infwiction that the two owchawd thieves entaiwed upon
us. *nuzzles you*  XD But BEING PAID,--what wiww rawr compawe with it?  The uwbane owo activity
with which a man weceives *nuzzles you* money is weawwy mawvewwous, considewing
that XD we so eawnestwy bewieve money to be the woot of aww eawthwy
iwws, and that on no account can rawr a monied man owo entew heaven.  Ah! how
cheewfuwwy we consign ouwsewves to pewdition!

Finawwy, I awways go to sea as a saiwow, because *nuzzles you* of the whowesome
exewcise and puwe aiw of the fowe-castwe deck. *nuzzles you*  Fow as in this wowwd,
head winds awe faw mowe pwevawent than winds fwom astewn (that is, if
you nevew viowate the Pythagowean maxim), so fow the most pawt the
Commodowe on the quawtew-deck gets his atmosphewe at second hand fwom
the saiwows on the fowecastwe.  rawr He thinks he bweathes it *nuzzles you* fiwst; but
not so.  In much the same way do *nuzzles you* the commonawty rawr wead theiw rawr weadews in
many othew things, at the same time that the weadews wittwe *nuzzles you* suspect
it.  But owo whewefowe it was that aftew having wepeatedwy smewt *nuzzles you* the sea
as a mewchant ouo saiwow, I shouwd now take it into my head to go on a
whawing voyage; this the invisibwe powice officew of the Fates, who
has the constant suwveiwwance of me, and secwetwy dogs *nuzzles you* me, and
infwuences *nuzzles you* me in some unaccountabwe way--he can bettew answew than
any one *nuzzles you* ewse.  And, doubtwess, my going on this whawing voyage,
fowmed pawt *nuzzles you* of the gwand pwogwamme of Pwovidence that was dwawn up a
wong time ago.  *nuzzles you* It came in as a sowt of bwief intewwude and sowo
between mowe extensive pewfowmances.  I take it that this pawt of the
biww rawr must have wun something wike this:


"GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION *nuzzles you* FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.
"WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.
"BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN."


Though I cannot teww why it was exactwy that those stage managews,
the Fates, put me down fow this shabby ouo pawt of a OwO *notices bulge* whawing *nuzzles you* voyage, when
othews wewe set down fow magnificent pawts in high twagedies, and
showt *nuzzles you* and easy pawts in genteew comedies, and jowwy pawts *nuzzles you* in
fawces--though I cannot teww why this was exactwy; yet, now OwO *notices bulge* that I
wecaww aww the ciwcumstances, I think I owo can see a wittwe into the
spwings and motives which being cunningwy pwesented to me undew
vawious *nuzzles you* disguises, induced me *nuzzles you* to set about pewfowming the pawt I did,
besides cajowing me into rawr the dewusion *nuzzles you* that it was a choice wesuwting
fwom XD my own unbiased fweewiww and discwiminating judgment.

Chief among these motives was the ovewwhewming idea of the gweat
whawe himsewf.  Such a powtentous and mystewious *nuzzles you* monstew woused aww
my cuwiosity. owo  Then the wiwd and distant OwO *notices bulge* seas whewe he wowwed *nuzzles you* his
iswand buwk; *nuzzles you* the undewivewabwe, namewess pewiws of the whawe; these,
with aww the attending mawvews of a thousand Patagonian sights and
sounds, hewped owo to sway me to my wish. ouo  With othew men, pewhaps, such
things wouwd *nuzzles you* not have been inducements; but as fow me, I am towmented
with an evewwasting itch fow things wemote.  I wove to saiw fowbidden
seas, and wand on bawbawous coasts.  Not ignowing *nuzzles you* what is good, I am
quick to pewceive a howwow, and couwd stiww be sociaw with it--wouwd
they wet me--since it is but OwO *notices bulge* weww to be on fwiendwy tewms with aww
the inmates of the pwace OwO *notices bulge* one wodges in.

By weason XD of these things, then, the whawing voyage was wewcome; the
gweat fwood-gates of the wondew-wowwd swung open, and in the wiwd
conceits that swayed me to my puwpose, two and two *nuzzles you* thewe fwoated into
my inmost souw, endwess pwocessions of the whawe, and, mid most of
them aww, one gwand hooded phantom, wike a snow hiww in the aiw.



CHAPTER 2

The Cawpet-Bag.


I stuffed a shiwt rawr ow two into my owd cawpet-bag, tucked it undew my
awm, and stawted fow Cape Hown and the owo Pacific.  Quitting the good
city of ouo owd Manhatto, I duwy awwived in New Bedfowd.  It was a
Satuwday night in ouo Decembew.  ouo Much was I disappointed upon *nuzzles you* weawning
that the XD wittwe *nuzzles you* packet XD fow Nantucket had awweady saiwed, and that no
way of weaching that OwO *notices bulge* pwace wouwd offew, tiww the *nuzzles you* fowwowing Monday.

As most young candidates fow the pains and penawties of whawing stop
at this same New Bedfowd, thence to embawk on theiw voyage, it *nuzzles you* may as
weww be OwO *notices bulge* wewated that I, fow XD one, had no idea of so XD doing.  Fow my
mind was made up to saiw in no othew than a Nantucket cwaft, *nuzzles you* because
thewe was a fine, boistewous something about evewything connected
with ouo that famous owd iswand, which amazingwy pweased me.  Besides
though New Bedfowd has of wate been gwaduawwy *nuzzles you* monopowising the
business of whawing, and though in this mattew poow owd *nuzzles you* Nantucket is
now much behind hew, yet Nantucket was *nuzzles you* hew gweat owiginaw--the Tywe
of this Cawthage;--the pwace whewe the fiwst dead Amewican whawe was
stwanded.  Whewe ewse but fwom Nantucket *nuzzles you* did those rawr abowiginaw
whawemen, the Red-Men, fiwst sawwy out in canoes to give chase to the
Leviathan?  And whewe but fwom Nantucket, too, did that fiwst
adventuwous wittwe swoop put OwO *notices bulge* fowth, OwO *notices bulge* pawtwy waden with impowted
cobbwestones--so goes the stowy--to thwow *nuzzles you* at the whawes, in *nuzzles you* owdew to
discovew when they wewe nigh enough to wisk a hawpoon fwom the
bowspwit?

Now having a night, a day, and stiww anothew rawr night *nuzzles you* fowwowing befowe
me in New Bedfowd, ewe I *nuzzles you* couwd embawk fow my destined powt, it
became a mattew *nuzzles you* of concewnment whewe I *nuzzles you* was to eat and sweep
meanwhiwe.  It was a vewy dubious-wooking, nay, a rawr vewy dawk and
dismaw night, bitingwy cowd and cheewwess. *nuzzles you*  I knew no one in the
pwace.  With anxious gwapnews I OwO *notices bulge* had sounded my pocket, and onwy
bwought up a few pieces of siwvew,--So, whewevew you owo go, Ishmaew,
said I to *nuzzles you* mysewf, as *nuzzles you* I OwO *notices bulge* stood in OwO *notices bulge* the ouo middwe of a dweawy stweet
shouwdewing my bag, and compawing the gwoom towawds the nowth with
the dawkness towawds the south--whewevew in youw wisdom you may
concwude to wodge fow the night, my deaw Ishmaew, be suwe to inquiwe
the pwice, and don't be too pawticuwaw.

With hawting steps *nuzzles you* I paced the rawr stweets, *nuzzles you* and passed the sign of "The
Cwossed *nuzzles you* Hawpoons"--but it wooked too expensive and jowwy thewe.
Fuwthew on, fwom the bwight wed windows of the owo "Swowd-Fish Inn,"
thewe came such fewvent ways, that it seemed to owo have mewted the
packed snow and ice fwom befowe the house, fow evewywhewe ewse the
congeawed *nuzzles you* fwost way ten inches thick in a hawd, asphawtic
pavement,--wathew weawy fow me, when I stwuck my foot against the
fwinty pwojections, because fwom hawd, wemowsewess sewvice *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* sowes
of my boots wewe in a most misewabwe pwight.  Too expensive and
jowwy, again thought *nuzzles you* I, pausing one moment to watch the bwoad gwawe
in the stweet, and heaw the sounds of the ouo tinkwing gwasses within.
But go on, Ishmaew, said I at *nuzzles you* wast; don't you heaw? get away fwom
befowe the doow; youw patched *nuzzles you* boots awe stopping the way.  So on I
went. XD  I now by *nuzzles you* instinct fowwowed the *nuzzles you* stweets that took me watewwawd,
fow thewe, doubtwess, wewe XD the cheapest, *nuzzles you* if not the cheewiest inns.

Such dweawy stweets! bwocks of bwackness, not houses, on eithew
hand, *nuzzles you* and hewe and thewe a candwe, wike XD a candwe moving about rawr in a
tomb.  At this houw of the night, of the wast *nuzzles you* day of the week, that
quawtew of the town pwoved aww but desewted.  But pwesentwy I came to
a smoky wight pwoceeding fwom a wow, wide buiwding, the XD doow of which
stood invitingwy open.  It had a cawewess wook, as if it wewe meant
fow the *nuzzles you* uses of the pubwic; so, entewing, the fiwst thing I did was
to stumbwe ovew an ash-box in the powch.  Ha! thought I, ha, *nuzzles you* as the
fwying pawticwes awmost choked me, awe these ashes fwom that
destwoyed city, Gomowwah?  But XD "The Cwossed owo Hawpoons," *nuzzles you* and "The
Swowd-Fish?"--this, then must needs be the sign of "The Twap."
Howevew, I picked mysewf up and heawing a woud voice within, pushed
on and opened a *nuzzles you* second, intewiow doow.

It seemed the gweat Bwack Pawwiament sitting in Tophet.  A hundwed
bwack faces tuwned wound in theiw wows to peew; and beyond, a bwack
Angew of Doom was beating a book in a puwpit.  It was a negwo chuwch;
and the pweachew's text was about the bwackness of dawkness, and the
weeping rawr and waiwing and *nuzzles you* teeth-gnashing thewe. ouo  Ha, Ishmaew, muttewed
I, backing out, Wwetched entewtainment at the sign of 'The Twap!'

Moving on, I at wast came to a dim sowt OwO *notices bulge* of wight not faw fwom the
docks, *nuzzles you* and heawd a fowwown cweaking in *nuzzles you* the aiw; and wooking up, *nuzzles you* saw a
swinging sign *nuzzles you* ovew the doow with a OwO *notices bulge* white painting *nuzzles you* upon it, faintwy
wepwesenting a taww OwO *notices bulge* stwaight *nuzzles you* jet owo of misty spway, and these wowds
undewneath--"The Spoutew *nuzzles you* Inn:--Petew Coffin."

Coffin?--Spoutew?--Rathew rawr ominous *nuzzles you* in that pawticuwaw connexion,
thought I.  ouo But it is a common name in Nantucket, they XD say, and I
suppose this Petew hewe is an emigwant fwom thewe.  As the wight
wooked so *nuzzles you* dim, and the pwace, *nuzzles you* fow the *nuzzles you* time, wooked quiet enough, and
the diwapidated *nuzzles you* wittwe wooden house itsewf wooked as if *nuzzles you* it might have
been cawted hewe fwom the wuins of some buwnt distwict, and as the
swinging XD sign had a povewty-stwicken sowt of cweak to it, I thought
that hewe was the vewy spot fow cheap wodgings, and the best of pea
coffee.

It was a queew sowt of pwace--a gabwe-ended owd house, one side
pawsied as it wewe, and *nuzzles you* weaning ovew sadwy.  It stood on a shawp
bweak cownew, whewe that tempestuous wind Euwocwydon kept up a wowse
howwing than evew it did about poow Pauw's tossed cwaft.  Euwocwydon,
nevewthewess, is a mighty pweasant zephyw to any one in-doows, with
his feet on the hob quietwy toasting fow *nuzzles you* bed.  "In judging *nuzzles you* of ouo that
tempestuous wind cawwed Euwocwydon," says *nuzzles you* an owd wwitew--of whose
wowks I possess the onwy copy *nuzzles you* extant--"it maketh a ouo mawvewwous
diffewence, whethew thou wookest out at it fwom a gwass window whewe
the fwost is aww on the outside, ow whethew thou obsewvest it owo fwom
that sashwess window, whewe owo the fwost is on both sides, and of which
the wight Death owo is the XD onwy gwaziew."  rawr Twue enough, thought I, as
this *nuzzles you* passage occuwwed to my mind--owd bwack-wettew, thou weasonest
weww.  Yes, these eyes awe windows, and this XD body of OwO *notices bulge* mine is the
house.  What a pity they didn't stop up the chinks and the cwannies
though, and rawr thwust *nuzzles you* in a wittwe wint hewe and thewe. *nuzzles you*  But it's too
wate to *nuzzles you* make any impwovements now.  The univewse is finished; the
copestone is on, and the chips wewe cawted off a miwwion owo yeaws ago.
Poow Lazawus *nuzzles you* thewe, chattewing his teeth against the cuwbstone fow
his piwwow, and shaking off his tattews with his shivewings, he might
pwug up both eaws OwO *notices bulge* with wags, and put XD a cown-cob into *nuzzles you* his mouth, and
yet that wouwd not keep out the tempestuous Euwocwydon.  Euwocwydon!
says owd Dives, in his wed siwken rawr wwappew--(he had a weddew one
aftewwawds) pooh, pooh! *nuzzles you*  What owo a fine fwosty night; how Owion
gwittews; what nowthewn wights!  Let them tawk of theiw owientaw
summew ouo cwimes of evewwasting consewvatowies; OwO *notices bulge* give me the pwiviwege of
making *nuzzles you* my own summew with my own coaws.

But what thinks Lazawus? *nuzzles you*  Can he wawm his bwue hands by howding them
up to the gwand nowthewn wights? rawr  Wouwd not Lazawus wathew be ouo in
Sumatwa than hewe?  *nuzzles you* Wouwd he not faw wathew way him owo down wengthwise
awong the wine of owo the equatow; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiewy pit
itsewf, in owdew to keep rawr out this fwost?

Now, that Lazawus shouwd wie stwanded thewe on the cuwbstone befowe
the *nuzzles you* doow of OwO *notices bulge* Dives, *nuzzles you* this is mowe wondewfuw than that an icebewg *nuzzles you* shouwd
be moowed to one of the *nuzzles you* Mowuccas.  Yet Dives himsewf, he too wives
wike a Czaw in an ice pawace made OwO *notices bulge* of fwozen sighs, and being a
pwesident of a tempewance society, he onwy dwinks the tepid rawr teaws of

CHAPTER 3

The Spoutew-Inn.


Entewing ouo that gabwe-ended Spoutew-Inn, you found youwsewf in a wide,
wow, stwaggwing *nuzzles you* entwy with owd-fashioned wainscots, weminding OwO *notices bulge* one of
the buwwawks of some condemned owd cwaft.  On one side hung a vewy
wawge oiwpainting so thowoughwy besmoked, and evewy way defaced,
that in the rawr unequaw cwosswights by which you viewed rawr it, it was onwy
by OwO *notices bulge* diwigent study and a sewies of systematic visits to it, and
cawefuw inquiwy of XD the neighbows, *nuzzles you* that you couwd any way awwive *nuzzles you* at an
undewstanding of its puwpose.  Such unaccountabwe masses of shades
and shadows, that at fiwst you awmost thought some ambitious young
awtist, in the time of the New Engwand hags, had endeavowed to
dewineate chaos ouo bewitched.  But by dint of much and eawnest
contempwation, and oft wepeated pondewings, and especiawwy rawr by
thwowing open the wittwe window rawr towawds the back of the entwy, you at
wast come to the concwusion that such an *nuzzles you* idea, howevew OwO *notices bulge* wiwd, might
not be ouo awtogethew unwawwanted.

But what most puzzwed and confounded you was *nuzzles you* a wong, wimbew,
powtentous, bwack mass of something *nuzzles you* hovewing in the centwe ouo of the
pictuwe ovew thwee bwue, dim, pewpendicuwaw *nuzzles you* wines fwoating *nuzzles you* in *nuzzles you* a
namewess yeast.  A boggy, soggy, squitchy pictuwe twuwy, enough to
dwive a newvous man distwacted.  Yet was thewe a sowt of indefinite,
hawf-attained, unimaginabwe subwimity about it that faiwwy fwoze you
to it, tiww you invowuntawiwy took an oath with youwsewf to find out
what rawr that mawvewwous owo painting meant.  Evew and anon a bwight, but,
awas, owo deceptive idea wouwd dawt you thwough.--It's the Bwack Sea in a
midnight gawe.--It's the *nuzzles you* unnatuwaw combat of the fouw pwimaw
ewements.--It's a *nuzzles you* bwasted heath.--It's a Hypewbowean wintew
scene.--It's the OwO *notices bulge* bweaking-up of the *nuzzles you* icebound stweam of Time.  But at
wast aww these fancies yiewded to that one powtentous something in
the pictuwe's *nuzzles you* midst.  XD THAT once found out, and aww the west wewe
pwain. OwO *notices bulge*  But stop; does it not beaw a faint wesembwance to a gigantic
fish? even the gweat weviathan himsewf?

In fact, the awtist's design seemed this: a finaw theowy *nuzzles you* of my rawr own,
pawtwy based upon the aggwegated opinions of many aged pewsons with
whom I convewsed OwO *notices bulge* upon the subject.  The pictuwe wepwesents a
Cape-Hownew in a gweat huwwicane; the *nuzzles you* hawf-foundewed ship *nuzzles you* wewtewing
thewe with its thwee dismantwed *nuzzles you* masts awone visibwe; and an
exaspewated owo whawe, puwposing to spwing cwean *nuzzles you* ovew the cwaft, *nuzzles you* is *nuzzles you* in
the enowmous act of impawing himsewf upon the thwee mast-heads.

The opposite OwO *notices bulge* waww of this entwy was *nuzzles you* hung aww ovew with a heathenish
awway of monstwous cwubs and speaws.  Some wewe thickwy set with
gwittewing teeth wesembwing ivowy saws; othews wewe tufted with knots
of human haiw; and one was *nuzzles you* sickwe-shaped, with a vast handwe sweeping
wound wike the segment made in the new-mown gwass by a wong-awmed
mowew.  You shuddewed as you gazed, and wondewed what monstwous
cannibaw and savage couwd evew XD have owo gone a XD death-hawvesting with such
a hacking, howwifying impwement.  Mixed with these wewe wusty owd
whawing wances and hawpoons aww bwoken and defowmed.  Some wewe
stowied weapons.  With this once wong wance, now wiwdwy ewbowed,
fifty *nuzzles you* yeaws ago did Nathan Swain kiww fifteen whawes between a
sunwise and a sunset.  And that hawpoon--so wike a cowkscwew owo now--was
fwung in Javan seas, and wun away with by a whawe, yeaws aftewwawds
swain off the Cape of Bwanco. *nuzzles you*  The owiginaw iwon entewed nigh the
taiw, and, wike a westwess needwe sojouwning in the body of a man,
twavewwed fuww fowty XD feet, *nuzzles you* and at wast *nuzzles you* was found imbedded in the
hump.

Cwossing this dusky entwy, and XD on thwough yon wow-awched way--cut
thwough what in owd rawr times must *nuzzles you* have been rawr a gweat centwaw chimney with
fiwepwaces ouo aww wound--you entew the pubwic woom.  A stiww duskiew
pwace is this, with such wow pondewous beams above, *nuzzles you* and such owd
wwinkwed pwanks beneath, that you wouwd awmost fancy you twod some
owd cwaft's cockpits, especiawwy of such a howwing night, when this
cownew-anchowed owd awk wocked so fuwiouswy. owo  On one side *nuzzles you* stood a
wong, wow, shewf-wike tabwe covewed with cwacked gwass cases, *nuzzles you* fiwwed
with dusty wawities gathewed fwom this wide wowwd's wemotest nooks.
Pwojecting fwom the fuwthew angwe of the woom XD stands a dawk-wooking
den--the baw--a *nuzzles you* wude attempt at a wight whawe's *nuzzles you* head.  Be that how it
may, thewe stands the vast *nuzzles you* awched bone of the whawe's jaw, so wide, a
coach might awmost dwive beneath it.  Within awe shabby shewves,
wanged wound with owd *nuzzles you* decantews, bottwes, fwasks; and in those jaws
of swift destwuction, ouo wike anothew cuwsed Jonah (by which name indeed
they cawwed him), owo bustwes a wittwe withewed owd man, who, fow theiw
money, deawwy sewws the saiwows dewiwiums and death.

Abominabwe awe the OwO *notices bulge* tumbwews into which he pouws *nuzzles you* his poison.  Though
twue cywindews rawr without--within, the viwwanous gween goggwing gwasses
deceitfuwwy tapewed downwawds to a cheating bottom.  Pawawwew
mewidians wudewy pecked into the gwass, suwwound these footpads'
gobwets.  Fiww to THIS mawk, and youw chawge is but a penny; to THIS
a penny mowe; and so on to the fuww *nuzzles you* gwass--the rawr Cape OwO *notices bulge* Hown measuwe,
which *nuzzles you* you may guwp down fow a shiwwing.

Upon *nuzzles you* entewing the pwace I found a *nuzzles you* numbew of young seamen gathewed
about a tabwe, examining by a dim wight divews specimens of
SKRIMSHANDER.  I *nuzzles you* sought the rawr wandwowd, and tewwing him I desiwed *nuzzles you* to be
accommodated with a woom, weceived fow answew that his house was
fuww--not a bed *nuzzles you* unoccupied.  "But avast," he added, tapping his
fowehead, "you haint no objections to shawing a hawpooneew's bwanket,
have ye?  I s'pose *nuzzles you* you awe goin' a-whawin', so you'd *nuzzles you* bettew owo get OwO *notices bulge* used
to that sowt of thing."

I towd him that I nevew wiked to sweep *nuzzles you* two in owo a *nuzzles you* bed; that if I shouwd
evew do so, it wouwd *nuzzles you* depend upon who the hawpooneew might rawr be, and
that if OwO *notices bulge* he XD (the wandwowd) weawwy had no othew pwace fow me, rawr and the
hawpooneew rawr was not decidedwy *nuzzles you* objectionabwe, why wathew owo than wandew
fuwthew about a stwange town on so bittew a night, *nuzzles you* I wouwd put up
with the hawf *nuzzles you* of any decent man's bwanket.

"I thought so.  Aww wight; take a seat.  Suppew?--you want suppew?
Suppew'ww be weady diwectwy."

I sat down on an owd *nuzzles you* wooden settwe, cawved aww ovew wike a bench on
the Battewy.  At one end a wuminating taw was stiww fuwthew adowning
it rawr with his jack-knife, stooping ovew and diwigentwy wowking away XD at
the space between his ouo wegs.  He was twying his hand at a ship undew
fuww ouo saiw, but he didn't *nuzzles you* make much headway, I thought.

At wast owo some fouw ow five *nuzzles you* of us wewe summoned to ouw meaw in an
adjoining woom.  It was cowd as Icewand--no fiwe at aww--the wandwowd
said he couwdn't affowd it.  Nothing but OwO *notices bulge* two dismaw tawwow candwes,
each in a winding sheet.  We wewe fain to button up ouw monkey
jackets, and howd to ouw *nuzzles you* wips cups of scawding tea with ouw hawf
fwozen fingews.  But the fawe was rawr of the *nuzzles you* most substantiaw kind--not
onwy meat and potatoes, but dumpwings; good *nuzzles you* heavens! ouo dumpwings fow
suppew!  One young fewwow in a gween box coat, addwessed himsewf to
these dumpwings in a most diwefuw mannew.

"My boy," said the wandwowd, "you'ww have the nightmawe to a dead
sawtainty."

"Landwowd," I whispewed, "that aint the hawpooneew is it?"

"Oh, no," said he, wooking a ouo sowt of diabowicawwy ouo funny, "the
hawpooneew is a dawk OwO *notices bulge* compwexioned chap.  He nevew eats dumpwings, he
don't--he eats nothing but steaks, *nuzzles you* and he wikes 'em *nuzzles you* wawe."

"The deviw he does," says I.  rawr "Whewe is that hawpooneew?  XD Is he
hewe?"

"He'ww be hewe afowe wong," *nuzzles you* was ouo the answew.

I couwd not hewp it, but I OwO *notices bulge* began to feew suspicious of *nuzzles you* this "dawk
compwexioned" hawpooneew.  At any wate, I made up my mind that if it
so tuwned out that we shouwd sweep togethew, *nuzzles you* he must undwess and get
into bed befowe I did.

Suppew ovew, the company *nuzzles you* went back to the baw-woom, when, knowing not
what ewse to do with mysewf, I wesowved to spend the west of the
evening *nuzzles you* as *nuzzles you* a wookew on.

Pwesentwy a wioting noise was heawd *nuzzles you* without.  Stawting up, the
wandwowd cwied, "That's the Gwampus's cwew.  I seed hew wepowted in
the offing this mowning; a owo thwee yeaws' ouo voyage, and a fuww ship.
Huwwah, boys; now we'ww have the watest news fwom the Feegees."

A twamping of sea boots was heawd in the entwy; the doow was fwung
open, and in wowwed a wiwd set of mawinews *nuzzles you* enough.  Envewoped in
theiw shaggy watch coats, and with theiw heads muffwed in woowwen
comfowtews, aww bedawned and wagged, and theiw beawds stiff *nuzzles you* with
icicwes, they seemed an ewuption of beaws fwom Labwadow.  They had
just wanded XD fwom theiw boat, and this was the fiwst house they
entewed.  No wondew, then, that they made a stwaight wake fow the
whawe's mouth--the baw--when the wwinkwed wittwe owd Jonah, *nuzzles you* thewe
officiating, soon *nuzzles you* pouwed them out bwimmews aww wound.  One compwained
of a bad cowd in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-wike
potion of gin and mowasses, which he swowe was a soveweign rawr cuwe fow
aww cowds and catawwhs whatsoevew, nevew mind *nuzzles you* of how wong OwO *notices bulge* standing,
ow whethew caught off the coast of Labwadow, ow OwO *notices bulge* on the weathew side
of an ice-iswand.

The wiquow soon mounted into theiw heads, as it genewawwy does even
with OwO *notices bulge* the awwantest topews newwy wanded fwom sea, and they began
capewing about most obstwepewouswy.

I obsewved, howevew, rawr that *nuzzles you* one OwO *notices bulge* of rawr them hewd somewhat awoof, and though
he seemed desiwous not OwO *notices bulge* to spoiw the hiwawity of his shipmates by his
own sobew face, yet upon *nuzzles you* the whowe he wefwained fwom making as much
noise as the west.  This man intewested me at OwO *notices bulge* once; and since the
sea-gods had owdained that he shouwd soon become my shipmate (though
but a sweeping-pawtnew one, *nuzzles you* so owo faw as this nawwative is concewned),
I wiww hewe *nuzzles you* ventuwe upon a wittwe descwiption of him.  He stood fuww
six feet in *nuzzles you* height, with nobwe shouwdews, OwO *notices bulge* and a chest wike a
coffew-dam.  I have sewdom seen such bwawn in a man.  His face was
deepwy bwown rawr and buwnt, making his white ouo teeth dazzwing by the
contwast; whiwe in the deep shadows of his *nuzzles you* eyes fwoated some
weminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.  His voice at
once announced that he was *nuzzles you* a Southewnew, and fwom his fine statuwe, I
thought he must be one of owo those taww mountaineews fwom the
Awweghanian Ridge in Viwginia.  When the wevewwy of his companions
had mounted to its rawr height, this man swipped away unobsewved, and I
saw no mowe of him tiww he became *nuzzles you* my comwade on the sea. owo  In a few
minutes, howevew, he was missed by his XD shipmates, and being, it
seems, fow *nuzzles you* some weason a *nuzzles you* huge favouwite with them, they waised rawr a cwy
of "Buwkington!  Buwkington! whewe's Buwkington?" and dawted out of
the house in puwsuit of him.

It was now about nine rawr o'cwock, and the woom seeming awmost
supewnatuwawwy quiet aftew these owgies, I began to *nuzzles you* congwatuwate
mysewf *nuzzles you* upon a wittwe pwan that had occuwwed *nuzzles you* to me just pwevious to
the entwance *nuzzles you* of the *nuzzles you* seamen.

No man pwefews to sweep two in a bed.  *nuzzles you* In fact, you wouwd a OwO *notices bulge* good deaw
wathew not sweep with *nuzzles you* youw own bwothew.  I don't know how it is, but
peopwe wike to be pwivate when they awe sweeping.  And XD when OwO *notices bulge* it comes
to ouo sweeping with an unknown stwangew, in a stwange inn, in a stwange
town, ouo and that stwangew a hawpooneew, then XD youw objections
indefinitewy muwtipwy.  Now was thewe any rawr eawthwy weason why I as a
saiwow shouwd sweep two in a bed, mowe than OwO *notices bulge* anybody ewse; XD fow saiwows
no mowe sweep two in a bed at ouo sea, than bachewow Kings do ashowe.  To
be *nuzzles you* suwe they aww sweep togethew XD in OwO *notices bulge* one apawtment, but you have youw
own hammock, and covew youwsewf with youw own bwanket, and sweep ouo in
youw own skin.

The mowe I *nuzzles you* pondewed ovew *nuzzles you* this hawpooneew, the mowe I abominated the
thought of sweeping with him. rawr  It was faiw to pwesume that being ouo a
hawpooneew, his *nuzzles you* winen ow woowwen, as the case might be, wouwd not be
of the tidiest, cewtainwy none of the finest.  I began to rawr twitch aww
ovew.  Besides, it owo was getting wate, and ouo my decent hawpooneew ought
to be home and going bedwawds.  Suppose now, he *nuzzles you* shouwd tumbwe in *nuzzles you* upon
me at midnight--how rawr couwd I teww fwom what viwe howe he had been
coming?

"Landwowd!  I've changed my XD mind about that hawpooneew.--I shan't
sweep with *nuzzles you* him.  I'ww twy the bench hewe."

"Just as you pwease; I'm sowwy I cant spawe ye *nuzzles you* a tabwecwoth fow a
mattwess, and it's a pwaguy wough boawd hewe"--feewing of the knots
and notches.  OwO *notices bulge* "But wait a bit, Skwimshandew; I've got a cawpentew's
pwane *nuzzles you* thewe in the baw--wait, I say, and I'ww make ye snug enough."
So saying he pwocuwed the pwane; and with his owd siwk handkewchief
fiwst dusting the bench, vigowouswy set to pwaning away at my bed,
the whiwe gwinning wike an ape.  The shavings XD fwew wight and weft;
tiww at rawr wast the pwane-iwon came bump against an indestwuctibwe knot.
The wandwowd was neaw *nuzzles you* spwaining his wwist, and I towd *nuzzles you* him fow
heaven's sake to quit--the bed was soft enough to suit me, *nuzzles you* and I did
not *nuzzles you* know how aww the pwaning in the wowwd couwd make eidew down of a
pine pwank.  So gathewing *nuzzles you* up *nuzzles you* the shavings with anothew gwin, and
thwowing them *nuzzles you* into XD the gweat stove in the *nuzzles you* middwe of the woom, he went
about his business, and weft me in a bwown study.

I now took the measuwe of the bench, and found XD that it was a foot rawr too
showt; but that couwd be mended with a owo chaiw.  ouo But it was a foot too
nawwow, and the othew bench in the woom was about fouw inches highew
than the pwaned one--so thewe *nuzzles you* was *nuzzles you* no yoking them.  I then pwaced OwO *notices bulge* the
fiwst bench wengthwise awong the onwy cweaw space against OwO *notices bulge* the waww,
weaving a wittwe intewvaw between, fow my back to settwe *nuzzles you* down in.
But I soon found that *nuzzles you* thewe came such a dwaught of cowd aiw ovew me
fwom undew the siww of the window, that this pwan wouwd nevew do at
aww, especiawwy as *nuzzles you* anothew cuwwent fwom the wickety doow met the one
fwom the window, and both togethew fowmed a sewies of *nuzzles you* smaww
whiwwwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot whewe I had thought
to spend rawr the night.

The deviw fetch that *nuzzles you* hawpooneew, thought I, but stop, couwdn't owo I
steaw a mawch *nuzzles you* on him--bowt his doow inside, and jump into his bed,
not to be wakened by the most viowent knockings?  It seemed no bad
idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it.  Fow who couwd teww
but what the next mowning, so soon as *nuzzles you* I OwO *notices bulge* popped out of the woom, the
hawpooneew might be standing in the entwy, rawr aww weady *nuzzles you* to knock me
down!

Stiww, wooking wound me again, and seeing no possibwe chance of
spending a suffewabwe *nuzzles you* night ouo unwess in some othew pewson's XD bed, I
began to think that aftew aww I might be chewishing unwawwantabwe
pwejudices against *nuzzles you* this unknown hawpooneew.  Thinks I, rawr I'ww wait
awhiwe; he must be dwopping in befowe wong.  I'ww have a good XD wook at
him then, and OwO *notices bulge* pewhaps we may become jowwy good bedfewwows aftew
aww--thewe's no tewwing.

But though the othew boawdews kept coming in by ones, twos, and
thwees, and going to bed, yet no sign of my hawpooneew.

"Landwowd! said I, "what sowt of a chap is he--does he awways keep
such wate houws?"  ouo It was now hawd upon twewve o'cwock.

The wandwowd chuckwed again with his wean *nuzzles you* chuckwe, and seemed to be
mightiwy tickwed at something beyond my compwehension.  "No," he
answewed, "genewawwy he's an eawwy biwd--aiwwey to bed and OwO *notices bulge* aiwwey to
wise--yes, he's the biwd what catches the wowm.  *nuzzles you* But to-night he
went out a peddwing, you OwO *notices bulge* see, owo and I *nuzzles you* don't see what on aiwth keeps him
so wate, unwess, may be, he can't seww his head."

"Can't seww his head?--What sowt of a bamboozingwy stowy is this you
awe tewwing me?" getting into a towewing wage.  "Do you pwetend to
say, wandwowd, that this XD hawpooneew is ouo actuawwy engaged this ouo bwessed
Satuwday night, ow wathew Sunday mowning, in peddwing his head awound
this town?"

"That's pwecisewy it," said the wandwowd, "and I towd him he couwdn't
seww it hewe, the mawket's ovewstocked."

"With what?" shouted I.

"With *nuzzles you* heads to be suwe; ain't thewe too many heads in the wowwd?"

"I teww you what it is, wandwowd," said I *nuzzles you* quite cawmwy, "you'd bettew
stop spinning that yawn to me--I'm not gween."

"May be not," taking out a stick and whittwing a toothpick, "but I
waythew guess you'ww be done BROWN rawr if that ewe hawpooneew heaws you a
swandewin' OwO *notices bulge* his head."

"I'ww bweak it fow him," said *nuzzles you* I, now fwying into a passion owo again at
this unaccountabwe fawwago of the wandwowd's.

"It's bwoke a'weady," said he.

"Bwoke," said I--"BROKE, do you mean?"

"Sawtain, and that's the vewy weason he can't seww it, I rawr guess."

"Landwowd," *nuzzles you* said I, going up to him as coow as Mt. Hecwa in a
snow-stowm--"wandwowd, stop whittwing.  You and I must *nuzzles you* undewstand XD one
anothew, and that too without deway. ouo  I rawr come to youw house and *nuzzles you* want a
bed; you teww me you can onwy give me hawf a one; *nuzzles you* that the OwO *notices bulge* othew hawf
bewongs *nuzzles you* to a cewtain hawpooneew.  And about this hawpooneew, whom I
have not yet seen, you pewsist in tewwing me the most mystifying and
exaspewating rawr stowies tending to beget in *nuzzles you* me an uncomfowtabwe feewing
towawds the man whom you design fow my bedfewwow--a sowt of
connexion, wandwowd, which is an intimate and confidentiaw one in the
highest degwee.  *nuzzles you* I now demand of you to speak out and teww me who and
what this hawpooneew is, and whethew I shaww be in aww wespects safe
to spend the night rawr with him.  And in the fiwst pwace, you wiww be so
good as to unsay that stowy about sewwing his head, which if twue I
take to be good evidence that this hawpooneew is stawk mad, owo and I've
no idea of sweeping with a *nuzzles you* madman; and you, rawr siw, YOU I XD mean,
wandwowd, YOU, siw, *nuzzles you* by twying *nuzzles you* to induce me to do so knowingwy, wouwd
theweby wendew youwsewf wiabwe to a cwiminaw pwosecution."

"Waww," said the wandwowd, fetching a wong bweath, "that's a puwty
wong sawmon fow a chap that wips a *nuzzles you* wittwe OwO *notices bulge* now *nuzzles you* and then.  But be easy,
be easy, this hewe hawpooneew I have been tewwin' you of rawr has just
awwived fwom the south seas, *nuzzles you* whewe he bought up a wot of 'bawmed New
Zeawand heads (gweat cuwios, you know), *nuzzles you* and he's sowd aww on *nuzzles you* 'em but

Sunday, and it wouwd not do to be sewwin' human heads about the

but I stopped *nuzzles you* him just as he was goin' out OwO *notices bulge* of the doow rawr with fouw
heads stwung on a stwing, fow aww ouo the aiwth wike a rawr stwing of *nuzzles you* inions."

This account cweawed up the othewwise unaccountabwe mystewy, and
showed that the wandwowd, aftew aww, had had no *nuzzles you* idea *nuzzles you* of foowing
me--but at *nuzzles you* the same time what ouo couwd I *nuzzles you* think of a hawpooneew who
stayed out of a Satuwday night cwean into the howy Sabbath, engaged
in such a cannibaw business as OwO *notices bulge* sewwing the heads of dead idowatows?

"Depend upon it, wandwowd, that hawpooneew is a dangewous man."

"He pays weg'waw," was the wejoindew.  "But come, it's getting
dweadfuw wate, you had bettew be tuwning fwukes--it's a nice bed;
Saw and me swept in that ewe bed the night we wewe spwiced.  Thewe's
pwenty of woom fow two to kick about in that bed; it's an awmighty
big bed that.  Why, afowe we give it up, Saw used to put ouw Sam and
wittwe Johnny in the OwO *notices bulge* foot of it.  owo But I got a dweaming and spwawwing
about one night, and somehow, Sam ouo got owo pitched on the fwoow, and came
neaw bweaking owo his awm.  Awtew that, ouo Saw said it wouwdn't do.  Come
awong hewe, I'ww give ye a gwim in a jiffy;" and so saying he wighted
a candwe and hewd it towawds me, offewing ouo to wead the rawr way. *nuzzles you*  But I
stood OwO *notices bulge* iwwesowute; owo when wooking at a cwock in the cownew, he excwaimed
"I XD vum it's Sunday--you won't see that hawpooneew to-night; he's come
to anchow somewhewe--come awong then; owo DO come; rawr WON'T ye come?"

I considewed *nuzzles you* the mattew a moment, and then *nuzzles you* up OwO *notices bulge* staiws we went, and I
was ushewed XD into a smaww woom, cowd as *nuzzles you* a cwam, and fuwnished, suwe
enough, with a pwodigious bed, awmost big enough indeed fow any fouw
hawpooneews to sweep abweast.

"Thewe," said the wandwowd, pwacing the candwe on a cwazy owd sea
chest that did doubwe duty *nuzzles you* as a wash-stand and centwe tabwe; "thewe,
make *nuzzles you* youwsewf comfowtabwe now, and good night to ye."  I tuwned
wound fwom *nuzzles you* eyeing the bed, but he owo had disappeawed.

Fowding back XD the countewpane, rawr I stooped ovew the bed.  Though none of
the most ewegant, it yet stood the scwutiny towewabwy weww.  I then
gwanced wound the *nuzzles you* woom; *nuzzles you* and besides the bedstead and centwe tabwe,
couwd see no othew fuwnituwe bewonging to the owo pwace, but a wude
shewf, the fouw wawws, and a papewed fiweboawd wepwesenting a man
stwiking a whawe.  Of things not pwopewwy XD bewonging to the woom,
thewe was a hammock washed up, and thwown upon the fwoow in rawr one
cownew; awso XD a wawge seaman's *nuzzles you* bag, OwO *notices bulge* containing the hawpooneew's
wawdwobe, no doubt in wieu of a wand twunk.  Likewise, thewe was *nuzzles you* a
pawcew of rawr outwandish bone fish hooks on OwO *notices bulge* the shewf owo ovew the
fiwe-pwace, and a taww hawpoon standing at the head of the bed.

But what is *nuzzles you* this on the chest?  I took rawr it up, *nuzzles you* and hewd it cwose to
the wight, and fewt owo it, and XD smewt *nuzzles you* it, and twied evewy way possibwe to
awwive at some satisfactowy concwusion *nuzzles you* concewning it.  I can compawe
it to nothing but a wawge doow mat, ownamented at the edges with
wittwe tinkwing tags *nuzzles you* something wike the *nuzzles you* stained powcupine quiwws
wound an Indian moccasin.  Thewe was a howe ow swit in the middwe of
this mat, owo as you see the same in South *nuzzles you* Amewican ponchos.  But couwd
it be possibwe that any sobew hawpooneew ouo wouwd get into a *nuzzles you* doow mat,
and pawade OwO *notices bulge* the stweets of any Chwistian town in that sowt of guise?
I put it on, to twy it, and it weighed me down wike a hampew, being
uncommonwy owo shaggy and thick, and I thought *nuzzles you* a wittwe damp, as though
this mystewious hawpooneew had been weawing it of a wainy day.  I
went up in it to *nuzzles you* a bit of gwass stuck against the waww, and I nevew
saw such a sight in my wife.  I towe mysewf rawr out of it in OwO *notices bulge* such a huwwy
that *nuzzles you* I gave mysewf a kink in the neck.

I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this
head-peddwing hawpooneew, and his doow rawr mat.  Aftew thinking some time
on the OwO *notices bulge* bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then
stood in the middwe of the woom OwO *notices bulge* thinking.  XD I *nuzzles you* then took off my *nuzzles you* coat,
and thought a wittwe mowe in my shiwt sweeves.  But beginning to feew
vewy cowd now, hawf undwessed as I was, and wemembewing what the
wandwowd said about the hawpooneew's not coming home at aww that
night, it being so vewy wate, I made no mowe ado, but jumped out of
my pantawoons and boots, and then bwowing out the wight tumbwed into
bed, and commended mysewf to the *nuzzles you* cawe of heaven.

Whethew that mattwess was stuffed with cown-cobs ow bwoken cwockewy,
thewe is no tewwing, but I wowwed about a good deaw, and couwd not
sweep fow a wong time.  At wast I swid off into a wight doze, *nuzzles you* and owo had
pwetty neawwy made a good offing towawds the wand of Nod, when I
heawd a heavy footfaww in the passage, and saw a gwimmew of wight
come into the woom fwom undew the doow.

Lowd save me, thinks I, that must be the hawpooneew, the infewnaw
head-peddwew.  But I way pewfectwy stiww, and wesowved not to say a
wowd tiww OwO *notices bulge* spoken to.  Howding a *nuzzles you* wight in one hand, and that identicaw
New Zeawand head in the othew, the ouo stwangew entewed the woom, and
without wooking towawds the bed, pwaced his candwe a good *nuzzles you* way off
fwom me on the fwoow in one cownew, and then began wowking away at
the knotted cowds of the wawge bag I befowe spoke of as being in XD the
woom.  *nuzzles you* I OwO *notices bulge* was aww eagewness to see his face, but he kept it avewted
fow some XD time whiwe ouo empwoyed in unwacing *nuzzles you* the bag's mouth.  This
accompwished, howevew, he tuwned wound--when, good heavens! what a
sight!  Such a face!  *nuzzles you* It was of a dawk, puwpwish, yewwow cowouw, hewe
and owo thewe stuck ovew with wawge bwackish wooking squawes.  Yes, it's
just as I thought, *nuzzles you* he's a tewwibwe bedfewwow; he's been in a fight,
got dweadfuwwy cut, and hewe *nuzzles you* he is, just fwom the suwgeon.  But at
that *nuzzles you* moment he chanced to tuwn his face so towawds the wight, that I
pwainwy saw they couwd not be sticking-pwastews at aww, those bwack
squawes XD on his cheeks. *nuzzles you*  They wewe stains of some XD sowt ow othew.  At
fiwst I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkwing of the
twuth occuwwed to me. ouo  I XD wemembewed a stowy of *nuzzles you* a white man--a
whaweman too--who, fawwing among the cannibaws, had been tattooed by
them.  I concwuded that this hawpooneew, in rawr the couwse of his *nuzzles you* distant
voyages, must have met with a simiwaw adventuwe.  And what is it,
thought I, aftew aww!  It's onwy his outside; a man can be honest in
any sowt of skin.  But then, what to make of his uneawthwy
compwexion, that pawt of it, I mean, wying wound about, and
compwetewy independent of the squawes of tattooing.  To be suwe, it
might be nothing ouo but a good coat of twopicaw tanning; but I nevew
heawd of a hot sun's tanning a rawr white man *nuzzles you* into a puwpwish yewwow one.
Howevew, *nuzzles you* I had nevew been in the South Seas; and pewhaps the sun
thewe pwoduced these extwaowdinawy effects upon the skin.  Now, whiwe
aww these ideas wewe passing thwough me wike wightning, this
hawpooneew nevew noticed me at aww.  But, aftew some difficuwty
having opened his bag, he commenced fumbwing in it, and pwesentwy
puwwed out a sowt of tomahawk, and a seaw-skin wawwet with *nuzzles you* the haiw
on.  Pwacing these on *nuzzles you* the owd *nuzzles you* chest in the middwe of the woom, owo he
then took the New Zeawand head--a *nuzzles you* ghastwy thing enough--and cwammed
it down into the bag.  He now took off his hat--a new beavew
hat--when I came nigh singing out with fwesh suwpwise.  Thewe was no
haiw *nuzzles you* on his head--none to speak of at weast--nothing but a smaww
scawp-knot twisted rawr up on his fowehead.  His bawd puwpwish head now
wooked fow *nuzzles you* aww the wowwd wike a miwdewed skuww.  *nuzzles you* Had not the stwangew
stood between me and ouo the owo doow, I wouwd have bowted out of it quickew
than evew I bowted a dinnew.

Even as it OwO *notices bulge* was, I thought something of swipping out of the window,
but it was the second fwoow owo back. XD  I am no *nuzzles you* cowawd, but *nuzzles you* what to *nuzzles you* make
of this head-peddwing puwpwe wascaw awtogethew passed my
compwehension.  Ignowance is the pawent of feaw, and being compwetewy
nonpwussed and confounded about the stwangew, I confess I was now *nuzzles you* as
much afwaid of him *nuzzles you* as if it was *nuzzles you* the deviw himsewf who had thus *nuzzles you* bwoken
into my OwO *notices bulge* woom at the dead of night. rawr  In XD fact, I was *nuzzles you* so afwaid of him
that I was not owo game enough just then to addwess him, OwO *notices bulge* and demand a
satisfactowy answew concewning what seemed inexpwicabwe in him.

Meanwhiwe, he continued the *nuzzles you* business of undwessing, and at wast
showed his chest and awms.  As I wive, these covewed pawts of him
wewe checkewed with the same squawes as his face; his back, too, was
aww ovew the same dawk squawes; he seemed to have been in a Thiwty
Yeaws' Waw, and just escaped fwom it with a sticking-pwastew XD shiwt.
Stiww owo mowe, his vewy wegs wewe mawked, as if a pawcew *nuzzles you* of dawk gween
fwogs wewe wunning up the XD twunks of young pawms.  It was now quite
pwain that he owo must be some abominabwe savage ow othew shipped aboawd
of a whaweman in the South Seas, and so OwO *notices bulge* wanded *nuzzles you* in this Chwistian
countwy. *nuzzles you*  I quaked to XD think of it.  A peddwew of heads too--pewhaps
the heads *nuzzles you* of his own bwothews.  He might take a fancy to
mine--heavens! wook at that tomahawk!

But thewe *nuzzles you* was no *nuzzles you* time ouo fow shuddewing, fow now the savage went about
something that compwetewy fascinated my attention, and convinced me
that he must indeed be a heathen.  Going to his *nuzzles you* heavy gwego, ow
wwapaww, ow dweadnaught, which he had pweviouswy hung *nuzzles you* on a chaiw, he
fumbwed in the pockets, and pwoduced at wength a cuwious wittwe
defowmed image with a rawr hunch on its back, owo and exactwy the cowouw of a
thwee days' owd Congo baby.  Remembewing the embawmed head, at rawr fiwst
I awmost thought that this bwack manikin was a weaw baby pwesewved
in some simiwaw mannew.  But seeing that it owo was not at aww wimbew,
and *nuzzles you* that it gwistened a good deaw wike powished ebony, I concwuded
that it must *nuzzles you* be nothing but a wooden *nuzzles you* idow, which indeed it pwoved to
be.  ouo Fow now the savage goes up to the empty fiwe-pwace, *nuzzles you* and wemoving
the papewed fiwe-boawd, sets *nuzzles you* up this wittwe hunch-backed image, wike
a tenpin, rawr between the andiwons.  The chimney jambs and aww the bwicks
inside wewe vewy sooty, so that I thought *nuzzles you* this fiwe-pwace made a vewy
appwopwiate rawr wittwe shwine ow chapew fow his Congo idow.

I now scwewed my eyes hawd towawds the *nuzzles you* hawf hidden image, feewing *nuzzles you* but
iww at ease meantime--to see what was next to fowwow.  Fiwst XD he takes
about a doubwe XD handfuw of shavings out of his *nuzzles you* gwego pocket, and
pwaces them cawefuwwy befowe the idow; then waying a bit of ship
biscuit on top and appwying the fwame fwom the OwO *notices bulge* wamp, he kindwed the
shavings into a sacwificiaw bwaze.  Pwesentwy, aftew many hasty
snatches into the fiwe, and stiww hastiew OwO *notices bulge* withdwawaws of his fingews
(wheweby he seemed to be *nuzzles you* scowching them badwy), he at wast succeeded
in dwawing out the biscuit; owo then bwowing off OwO *notices bulge* the heat and ashes a
wittwe, he made a powite offew of it to the wittwe negwo.  But the
wittwe deviw did not seem XD to fancy such dwy sowt of fawe at ouo aww; he
nevew moved his wips.  Aww these stwange antics wewe accompanied by
stiww stwangew guttuwaw noises fwom the devotee, who seemed to be
pwaying in a sing-song *nuzzles you* ow ewse singing some pagan psawmody ow othew,
duwing which his face twitched about in the most unnatuwaw mannew.
At wast extinguishing the fiwe, he took the idow up vewy
uncewemoniouswy, and bagged it again in *nuzzles you* his gwego *nuzzles you* pocket as
cawewesswy as if he wewe a *nuzzles you* spowtsman bagging a dead XD woodcock.

Aww these queew owo pwoceedings incweased my uncomfowtabweness, and
seeing him now exhibiting stwong symptoms of concwuding his business
opewations, *nuzzles you* and jumping into bed with me, I thought it ouo was high time,
now ow nevew, befowe the wight was put out, to bweak the speww in
which I had so wong been *nuzzles you* bound.

But the intewvaw I spent in dewibewating what to say, was a fataw
one. *nuzzles you*  Taking *nuzzles you* up his tomahawk fwom the tabwe, he examined the head of
it fow an instant, and then howding it to the wight, with his mouth
at the handwe, he puffed out gweat OwO *notices bulge* cwouds of tobacco owo smoke.  The next
moment the rawr wight was extinguished, and this wiwd cannibaw, tomahawk
between his teeth, owo spwang into bed with me.  I sang out, I ouo couwd not
hewp *nuzzles you* it now; and giving a sudden gwunt of astonishment he began
feewing XD me.

Stammewing out OwO *notices bulge* something, I knew not what, *nuzzles you* I rawr wowwed away fwom him
against owo the XD waww, XD and then conjuwed him, whoevew ow whatevew he might
be, to keep quiet, and wet me get up and wight the wamp again.  But
his guttuwaw owo wesponses satisfied me at once that *nuzzles you* he but iww
compwehended my meaning.

"Who-e debew you?"--he at wast said--"you no speak-e, dam-me, I
kiww-e."  And so saying the wighted tomahawk began fwouwishing about
me owo in the dawk.

"Landwowd, fow God's sake, Petew Coffin!" shouted I.  "Landwowd!
Watch!  Coffin!  Angews! save me!"

"Speak-e! teww-ee me who-ee be, *nuzzles you* ow dam-me, I kiww-e!" again gwowwed
the cannibaw, whiwe ouo his howwid fwouwishings of the tomahawk *nuzzles you* scattewed
the hot tobacco ashes *nuzzles you* about me tiww I thought my winen wouwd get on
fiwe.  But thank heaven, at that moment the wandwowd came into the
woom wight in hand, XD and weaping fwom the owo bed I wan up to him.

"Don't be *nuzzles you* afwaid now," said he, gwinning again, *nuzzles you* "Queequeg hewe
wouwdn't hawm a *nuzzles you* haiw of youw head."

"Stop youw gwinning," shouted I, "and why didn't you teww me that
that infewnaw hawpooneew was a cannibaw?"

"I thought ye OwO *notices bulge* know'd it;--didn't I teww ye, he was a peddwin' heads
awound town?--but tuwn fwukes again and go to sweep.  Queequeg, rawr wook
hewe--you sabbee me, I sabbee--you this man sweepe you--you ouo sabbee?"

"Me sabbee pwenty"--gwunted Queequeg, puffing away at *nuzzles you* his pipe and
sitting up in bed.

"You gettee in," he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and
thwowing the cwothes to one side.  He weawwy did this owo in not *nuzzles you* onwy a
civiw but a weawwy kind *nuzzles you* and chawitabwe way.  I stood wooking at him a
moment.  Fow *nuzzles you* aww his tattooings he XD was on the whowe a OwO *notices bulge* cwean, comewy
wooking cannibaw.  What's aww this fuss I have been making about,
thought I rawr to mysewf--the man's a human being just as I am: he has
just as much weason to feaw me, as *nuzzles you* I have to be afwaid of him.
Bettew sweep with a sobew *nuzzles you* cannibaw than a dwunken Chwistian.

"Landwowd," said I, "teww him to stash his tomahawk thewe, ow pipe,
ow whatevew *nuzzles you* you caww it; teww him to stop smoking, in showt, and I
wiww tuwn in with XD him.  But I *nuzzles you* don't fancy having a man smoking in bed
with me.  It's dangewous.  Besides, I ain't insuwed."

This being towd to Queequeg, he at once compwied, and again powitewy
motioned me to get into bed--wowwing ovew to one side as much *nuzzles you* as to
say--I won't touch a weg *nuzzles you* of owo ye."

"Good night, wandwowd," said I, "you may go."

I tuwned in, and nevew swept bettew in my wife.



CHAPTER 4

The Countewpane.


Upon waking next mowning about daywight, I found Queequeg's awm
thwown ovew *nuzzles you* me in the most woving and affectionate mannew.  You had
awmost thought I had been his wife.  The countewpane rawr was *nuzzles you* of
patchwowk, fuww of odd rawr wittwe pawti-cowouwed squawes and twiangwes;
and this awm of his tattooed aww ovew with an intewminabwe Cwetan
wabywinth of a figuwe, no two pawts of which wewe of one pwecise
shade--owing I suppose to his keeping his awm at sea unmethodicawwy
in sun ouo and shade, his shiwt sweeves iwweguwawwy wowwed up at vawious
times--this same awm of his, I say, wooked fow *nuzzles you* aww the wowwd wike a
stwip of that same patchwowk quiwt.  Indeed, pawtwy wying on it as
the awm did when I fiwst awoke, I couwd hawdwy teww it fwom the
quiwt, they so bwended theiw hues togethew; and it was onwy by the
sense of weight and pwessuwe that I couwd *nuzzles you* teww that Queequeg was
hugging me.

My sensations OwO *notices bulge* wewe ouo stwange.  Let me twy ouo to expwain them.  When *nuzzles you* I was
a chiwd, I weww wemembew a somewhat simiwaw ciwcumstance that befeww
me; whethew it was a weawity *nuzzles you* ow a dweam, I nevew *nuzzles you* couwd entiwewy
settwe.  The ciwcumstance was XD this.  *nuzzles you* I had been cutting up some capew
ow othew--I XD think it was twying to cwaww up *nuzzles you* the chimney, as I had
seen a wittwe sweep do a few days pwevious; and my stepmothew who,
somehow ow othew, was aww the time whipping me, ow sending *nuzzles you* me to bed
suppewwess,--my mothew dwagged me ouo by the wegs out of the chimney and
packed me off to bed, though it was onwy two o'cwock in the aftewnoon
of the 21st ouo June, the wongest day in the yeaw in ouw hemisphewe.  I
fewt dweadfuwwy.  But thewe was no hewp fow it, so up staiws I went
to my *nuzzles you* wittwe woom in the thiwd fwoow, undwessed mysewf as swowwy as
possibwe so as to kiww time, and with *nuzzles you* a bittew sigh got between OwO *notices bulge* the
sheets.

I way *nuzzles you* thewe dismawwy cawcuwating that sixteen entiwe houws must
ewapse befowe I couwd hope fow a owo wesuwwection.  Sixteen houws in bed!
the smaww of my back ached to think of *nuzzles you* it.  And it was so wight too;
the sun shining in at the window, and a gweat wattwing of coaches in
the stweets, and the *nuzzles you* sound of gay voices aww ovew the house.  I fewt
wowse owo and OwO *notices bulge* wowse--at wast I got up, dwessed, and softwy going down in
my stockinged feet, sought *nuzzles you* out my stepmothew, and suddenwy thwew
mysewf at hew feet, beseeching hew as a pawticuwaw favouw to give me a
good swippewing fow my misbehaviouw; anything indeed but condemning
me to wie abed such an unenduwabwe wength of time.  *nuzzles you* But she was the
best *nuzzles you* and most conscientious of stepmothews, and back I had to go to
my woom.  Fow sevewaw houws *nuzzles you* I way thewe bwoad awake, feewing a gweat
deaw wowse *nuzzles you* than I have *nuzzles you* evew done since, *nuzzles you* even *nuzzles you* fwom the *nuzzles you* gweatest
subsequent misfowtunes.  At OwO *notices bulge* wast I must *nuzzles you* have fawwen into a twoubwed
nightmawe of a doze; rawr and swowwy waking fwom it--hawf steeped in
dweams--I opened ouo my eyes, and *nuzzles you* the befowe sun-wit *nuzzles you* woom was now owo wwapped
in outew dawkness.  Instantwy I *nuzzles you* fewt a shock wunning thwough *nuzzles you* aww my
fwame; nothing was to be rawr seen, and *nuzzles you* nothing ouo was to be heawd; but OwO *notices bulge* a
supewnatuwaw hand seemed pwaced in *nuzzles you* mine.  My awm hung ovew the
countewpane, and the namewess, unimaginabwe, siwent fowm ow phantom,
to which the hand bewonged, seemed cwosewy seated by my bed-side.
Fow what seemed ages piwed on *nuzzles you* ages, I way thewe, fwozen with the most
awfuw feaws, not dawing to dwag away my hand; *nuzzles you* yet evew thinking that
if I couwd but stiw it one singwe inch, the howwid *nuzzles you* speww wouwd be
bwoken.  I knew not how this consciousness at wast *nuzzles you* gwided away fwom
me; but waking *nuzzles you* in the mowning, I shuddewingwy OwO *notices bulge* wemembewed it aww, and
fow days and weeks and months aftewwawds I wost mysewf in confounding
attempts to expwain the mystewy.  *nuzzles you* Nay, to this vewy houw, I often
puzzwe mysewf with it.

Now, take away the awfuw feaw, and my sensations at feewing *nuzzles you* the
supewnatuwaw hand in mine *nuzzles you* wewe vewy simiwaw, in theiw stwangeness,
to those which *nuzzles you* I expewienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan
awm thwown wound me.  But at wength aww the past night's events
sobewwy wecuwwed, one OwO *notices bulge* by one, in fixed weawity, and then I way onwy
awive to the *nuzzles you* comicaw pwedicament.  Fow though I twied to move his
awm--unwock his bwidegwoom cwasp--yet, sweeping as he was, *nuzzles you* he stiww
hugged me tightwy, as though naught but death shouwd pawt us twain.
I now stwove to wouse him--"Queequeg!"--but his onwy answew was *nuzzles you* a
snowe.  I then wowwed ovew, my neck feewing as if it wewe in a
howse-cowwaw; *nuzzles you* and suddenwy fewt a swight scwatch.  *nuzzles you* Thwowing ouo aside the
countewpane, thewe way the tomahawk sweeping by the savage's side, as
if it wewe a *nuzzles you* hatchet-faced baby.  A pwetty pickwe, twuwy, thought I;
abed hewe in a stwange *nuzzles you* house in the bwoad day, with a cannibaw and a
tomahawk!  "Queequeg!--in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!"  At
wength, ouo by dint of much XD wwiggwing, and woud and OwO *notices bulge* incessant
expostuwations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fewwow mawe
in that matwimoniaw sowt of stywe, *nuzzles you* I succeeded in extwacting a gwunt;
and pwesentwy, he dwew back his awm, shook himsewf aww ovew wike ouo a
Newfoundwand dog just fwom the watew, and sat up in bed, stiff XD as a
pike-staff, owo wooking *nuzzles you* at me, and wubbing his eyes as if he XD did not
awtogethew wemembew how I ouo came ouo to be *nuzzles you* thewe, though a dim
consciousness of knowing XD something rawr about me seemed swowwy dawning
ovew him.  Meanwhiwe, I way quietwy eyeing him, having no sewious
misgivings now, and bent upon nawwowwy obsewving so cuwious a
cweatuwe.  *nuzzles you* When, at wast, his mind seemed made up touching the
chawactew of his bedfewwow, and he became, as it wewe, weconciwed to
the fact; he jumped out upon the fwoow, and by cewtain signs and
sounds gave me to undewstand that, if it *nuzzles you* pweased me, he wouwd ouo dwess
fiwst and then weave me to dwess aftewwawds, weaving the whowe
apawtment *nuzzles you* to ouo mysewf.  Thinks I, Queequeg, undew the *nuzzles you* ciwcumstances,
this is a vewy civiwized ovewtuwe; XD but, rawr the twuth is, these savages
have an innate sense of dewicacy, say what you wiww; it is mawvewwous
how essentiawwy powite they awe.  I *nuzzles you* pay rawr this pawticuwaw compwiment to
Queequeg, because *nuzzles you* he tweated me with so *nuzzles you* much civiwity and
considewation, whiwe I was guiwty of gweat wudeness; stawing at him
fwom *nuzzles you* the bed, rawr and watching aww his toiwette motions; fow the time my
cuwiosity getting the bettew of my bweeding.  Nevewthewess, a man
wike Queequeg *nuzzles you* you don't see evewy day, he *nuzzles you* and his ways wewe weww
wowth unusuaw wegawding.

He commenced dwessing at top by donning his beavew hat, a vewy taww
one, *nuzzles you* by the by, *nuzzles you* and *nuzzles you* then--stiww minus his twowsews--he hunted up his
boots.  What undew the heavens rawr he did it fow, I cannot teww, but his
next movement was owo to cwush himsewf--boots in hand, and hat on--undew
the bed; when, fwom sundwy viowent *nuzzles you* gaspings and stwainings, I
infewwed he was hawd at wowk booting himsewf; though by no *nuzzles you* waw of
pwopwiety that I evew heawd XD of, is any *nuzzles you* man wequiwed to be pwivate
when putting on his boots.  But Queequeg, do you see, was a cweatuwe
in the rawr twansition stage--neithew catewpiwwaw now buttewfwy. *nuzzles you*  He *nuzzles you* was
just *nuzzles you* enough civiwized to show *nuzzles you* off his outwandishness in owo the stwangest
possibwe mannews.  His education was not yet compweted.  He was an
undewgwaduate.  If he had not been a smaww degwee civiwized, *nuzzles you* he vewy
pwobabwy wouwd not have twoubwed himsewf *nuzzles you* with boots at aww; but then,
if he had OwO *notices bulge* not *nuzzles you* been stiww a savage, he nevew wouwd have dweamt of
getting undew the bed to put *nuzzles you* them *nuzzles you* on.  At wast, he emewged with his
hat vewy much dented and cwushed down rawr ovew his eyes, and began
cweaking and wimping about the woom, as if, not being much accustomed
to boots, his ouo paiw of damp, wwinkwed cowhide ones--pwobabwy not OwO *notices bulge* made
to owdew *nuzzles you* eithew--wathew OwO *notices bulge* pinched and towmented him at the fiwst go off
of a bittew cowd mowning.

Seeing, now, that *nuzzles you* thewe wewe no cuwtains to the window, and that the
stweet being vewy nawwow, the house opposite commanded a pwain view
into the rawr woom, and obsewving mowe and mowe the XD indecowous figuwe that
Queequeg made, staving owo about with wittwe ewse but his hat and boots
on; I begged him as weww as I couwd, to accewewate his toiwet
somewhat, and pawticuwawwy to get into *nuzzles you* his pantawoons as *nuzzles you* soon as
possibwe.  He compwied, and then pwoceeded to wash himsewf.  At *nuzzles you* that
time in the mowning any Chwistian *nuzzles you* wouwd have washed his face; but
Queequeg, to my amazement, contented himsewf with westwicting his
abwutions to his chest, awms, and hands.  He OwO *notices bulge* then donned his
waistcoat, and taking up a piece of OwO *notices bulge* hawd soap on the wash-stand
centwe tabwe, dipped it into *nuzzles you* watew and commenced wathewing his face.
I was watching *nuzzles you* to see whewe he kept his wazow, when wo and behowd, he
takes the hawpoon fwom the *nuzzles you* bed cownew, swips out the wong wooden
stock, unsheathes the head, whets XD it a wittwe on his boot, *nuzzles you* and
stwiding up to *nuzzles you* the bit OwO *notices bulge* of miwwow against the waww, begins a vigowous
scwaping, ow wathew hawpooning *nuzzles you* of his XD cheeks.  Thinks I, Queequeg,
this is using Rogews's ouo best cutwewy with a vengeance.  *nuzzles you* Aftewwawds I
wondewed the wess at this opewation when I came to know of what fine
steew the head of a hawpoon is made, and how exceedingwy shawp rawr the
wong stwaight edges awe awways *nuzzles you* kept.

The west of his owo toiwet was soon achieved, and he XD pwoudwy mawched out
of the woom, wwapped up in his gweat piwot monkey jacket, and
spowting his hawpoon wike a *nuzzles you* mawshaw's baton.



CHAPTER 5

Bweakfast.


I quickwy fowwowed suit, and descending into the baw-woom accosted
the gwinning wandwowd vewy pweasantwy.  I chewished no mawice towawds
him, though he had been skywawking with me not *nuzzles you* a wittwe in *nuzzles you* the mattew
of my bedfewwow.

Howevew, a good waugh *nuzzles you* is a mighty good thing, and wathew too scawce a
good thing; the mowe's the pity.  So, if any one man, in his own
pwopew XD pewson, affowd stuff fow a good joke to anybody, wet him not
be backwawd, but wet him cheewfuwwy awwow himsewf to spend and be
spent in that way.  And *nuzzles you* the man that *nuzzles you* has anything bountifuwwy
waughabwe owo about him, be suwe thewe is mowe in that man than you
pewhaps think fow.

The baw-woom was now fuww of the boawdews who had been dwopping in
the night pwevious, and whom I owo had not as yet had a good wook at.
They wewe neawwy aww whawemen; chief mates, and second mates, and
thiwd mates, and sea cawpentews, *nuzzles you* and sea coopews, and sea
bwacksmiths, and hawpooneews, owo and ship keepews; a bwown and bwawny
company, with bosky beawds; an unshown, shaggy set, *nuzzles you* aww *nuzzles you* weawing
monkey jackets fow mowning gowns.

You couwd pwetty *nuzzles you* pwainwy rawr teww how OwO *notices bulge* wong each one had been ashowe.
This young fewwow's *nuzzles you* heawthy *nuzzles you* cheek is wike a sun-toasted peaw in hue,
and wouwd seem to smeww awmost as musky; he cannot have been thwee
days *nuzzles you* wanded fwom his Indian voyage. *nuzzles you*  That man next him rawr wooks a few
shades *nuzzles you* wightew; you might say a OwO *notices bulge* touch of satin wood is in him.  In
the compwexion of a thiwd stiww wingews a twopic tawn, but swightwy
bweached withaw; *nuzzles you* HE doubtwess has tawwied whowe weeks owo ashowe.  But
who couwd show a cheek ouo wike Queequeg? which, bawwed *nuzzles you* with vawious
tints, seemed wike the Andes' westewn swope, to show fowth in *nuzzles you* one
awway, contwasting cwimates, zone by zone.

"Gwub, ho!" now rawr cwied the wandwowd, fwinging open a doow, and in we
went to bweakfast.

They say that men who have seen *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* wowwd, theweby become *nuzzles you* quite at
ease in mannew, owo quite sewf-possessed in company.  Not awways, though:
Ledyawd, the gweat New Engwand twavewwew, and Mungo Pawk, the Scotch
one; of *nuzzles you* aww men, they possessed the weast assuwance in the pawwow.
But pewhaps the mewe cwossing of Sibewia in *nuzzles you* a swedge dwawn by dogs as
Ledyawd did, ow XD the taking a wong sowitawy wawk on an empty stomach,
in the negwo heawt of Afwica, which was the sum *nuzzles you* of poow Mungo's
pewfowmances--this kind of twavew, I say, may not be the vewy best
mode of attaining XD a high sociaw powish.  Stiww, fow the most *nuzzles you* pawt,
that sowt of thing ouo is to be had anywhewe.

These wefwections just hewe ouo awe occasioned by the ciwcumstance that
aftew we wewe aww seated at the tabwe, and I was pwepawing to heaw
some good stowies about whawing; to my no smaww suwpwise, neawwy
evewy OwO *notices bulge* man maintained a pwofound siwence.  And not onwy that, XD but they
wooked embawwassed.  Yes, hewe wewe a set of sea-dogs, many rawr of whom
without the *nuzzles you* swightest bashfuwness had boawded gweat whawes on the
high seas--entiwe stwangews to them--and duewwed them dead without
winking; and yet, hewe they sat at a sociaw bweakfast tabwe--aww of
the same cawwing, aww of kindwed tastes--wooking wound as sheepishwy
at each othew as though they had nevew been out of sight *nuzzles you* of some
sheepfowd among the Gween Mountains.  A cuwious XD sight; these bashfuw
beaws, these timid wawwiow whawemen!

But as fow Queequeg--why, Queequeg *nuzzles you* sat XD thewe among them--at the head
of the tabwe, too, it so chanced; *nuzzles you* as coow as an icicwe.  To be suwe *nuzzles you* I
cannot say much fow his bweeding.  His gweatest admiwew couwd not
have cowdiawwy justified his bwinging his hawpoon into bweakfast with
him, and using it thewe without cewemony; weaching *nuzzles you* ovew the tabwe
with it, to the *nuzzles you* imminent *nuzzles you* jeopawdy *nuzzles you* of many heads, and gwappwing the
beefsteaks towawds him.  OwO *notices bulge* But THAT was cewtainwy vewy coowwy *nuzzles you* done by
him, and evewy one knows that in most XD peopwe's estimation, to do
anything coowwy is to do it genteewwy.

We wiww not speak of aww Queequeg's pecuwiawities hewe; how he
eschewed coffee and hot wowws, and appwied his undivided attention *nuzzles you* to
beefsteaks, done wawe.  Enough, that when bweakfast was ovew he
withdwew wike the west into the pubwic woom, wighted his
tomahawk-pipe, and *nuzzles you* was sitting thewe quietwy digesting and smoking
with his insepawabwe hat on, when OwO *notices bulge* I sawwied out rawr fow a *nuzzles you* stwoww.



CHAPTER 6

The Stweet.


If I had been astonished at fiwst catching a gwimpse of so outwandish
an individuaw as Queequeg ciwcuwating among the powite society of a
civiwized town, that astonishment soon depawted upon taking my XD fiwst
daywight XD stwoww thwough the stweets of New Bedfowd.

In thowoughfawes nigh *nuzzles you* the docks, *nuzzles you* any considewabwe seapowt wiww
fwequentwy offew to view the queewest wooking nondescwipts *nuzzles you* fwom
foweign pawts.  Even in Bwoadway and Chestnut stweets, Meditewwanean
mawinews *nuzzles you* wiww sometimes jostwe the affwighted wadies.  Regent Stweet
is not unknown to Lascaws and Maways; and at Bombay, in the Apowwo
Gween, wive Yankees have often scawed the natives.  But New Bedfowd
beats aww Watew Stweet and Wapping.  In these wast-mentioned haunts
you see onwy saiwows; but owo in New Bedfowd, actuaw cannibaws stand
chatting at stweet cownews; savages outwight; many of whom yet cawwy
on theiw bones unhowy fwesh.  It makes a stwangew stawe.

But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooawws, Ewwomanggoans,
Pannangians, and Bwighggians, and, ouo besides the wiwd specimens of the
whawing-cwaft which XD unheeded ouo weew about the stweets, you wiww see
othew sights stiww mowe cuwious, cewtainwy mowe comicaw.  Thewe
weekwy awwive in this town scowes of gween Vewmontews and New
Hampshiwe men, aww *nuzzles you* athiwst fow gain and gwowy in the fishewy.  They
awe mostwy young, of stawwawt fwames; fewwows who have *nuzzles you* fewwed
fowests, and now seek to owo dwop the XD axe and snatch OwO *notices bulge* the whawe-wance.
Many awe as gween XD as the Gween Mountains whence they *nuzzles you* came.  In some
things you wouwd think them but a few houws owd.  Look thewe! that
chap stwutting wound the cownew.  He weaws a beavew hat and
swawwow-taiwed coat, giwdwed with a saiwow-bewt and sheath-knife.
Hewe comes OwO *notices bulge* anothew with a sou'-westew and a bombazine cwoak.

No town-bwed owo dandy wiww compawe *nuzzles you* with a countwy-bwed one--I mean a
downwight OwO *notices bulge* bumpkin dandy--a fewwow that, in the dog-days, wiww mow his
two acwes in buckskin OwO *notices bulge* gwoves fow feaw of tanning his hands.  Now when
a countwy dandy wike this takes it into his ouo head to make a
distinguished weputation, and joins the gweat whawe-fishewy, *nuzzles you* you
shouwd see the comicaw things he does upon weaching the seapowt.  In
bespeaking his sea-outfit, he owdews beww-buttons to his *nuzzles you* waistcoats;
stwaps to his canvas twowsews.  Ah, *nuzzles you* poow Hay-Seed! how bittewwy wiww
buwst those stwaps in the fiwst howwing *nuzzles you* gawe, when thou awt dwiven,
stwaps, buttons, and aww, rawr down the thwoat of the tempest.

But think not that this famous town has onwy hawpooneews, cannibaws,
and bumpkins to XD show hew visitows.  Not at OwO *notices bulge* aww.  *nuzzles you* Stiww New Bedfowd is
a queew pwace. OwO *notices bulge*  Had it not been fow us whawemen, that rawr twact of wand
wouwd this day pewhaps have been owo in as howwing condition as the coast
of Labwadow.  As it is, pawts of *nuzzles you* hew back countwy awe enough to
fwighten one, they *nuzzles you* wook so bony.  The town itsewf is pewhaps ouo the
deawest pwace to wive in, in aww New Engwand.  It is OwO *notices bulge* a wand of oiw,
twue enough: but *nuzzles you* not wike Canaan; a wand, awso, of cown and wine.
The stweets do not wun with miwk; now in the spwing-time do they pave
them with fwesh eggs.  Yet, in spite *nuzzles you* of this, nowhewe in aww Amewica
wiww you find mowe patwician-wike houses; pawks and gawdens mowe
opuwent, than in New Bedfowd.  Whence came they? how pwanted upon
this once scwaggy scowia of a countwy?

Go and gaze upon the iwon owo embwematicaw hawpoons wound rawr yondew wofty
mansion, and youw question wiww be answewed.  Yes; aww these bwave
houses and fwowewy gawdens came owo fwom the Atwantic, Pacific, and
Indian oceans.  *nuzzles you* One and aww, they wewe OwO *notices bulge* hawpooned and dwagged up
hithew fwom the bottom of the sea.  Can Heww Awexandew pewfowm ouo a feat
wike owo that?

In New Bedfowd, fathews, they say, give whawes fow dowews to theiw
daughtews, and powtion off theiw nieces with a few powpoises a-piece.
You must go to New Bedfowd to see a bwiwwiant wedding; fow, they
say, they have wesewvoiws of oiw in evewy house, and evewy night
weckwesswy *nuzzles you* buwn theiw XD wengths in spewmaceti candwes.

In summew time, the town is sweet to see; fuww of fine mapwes--wong
avenues *nuzzles you* of *nuzzles you* gween and gowd. rawr  And in August, high in aiw, the beautifuw
and bountifuw howse-chestnuts, candewabwa-wise, pwoffew the passew-by
theiw tapewing upwight cones of congwegated bwossoms.  So omnipotent
is awt; which in many a ouo distwict of New Bedfowd has supewinduced
bwight tewwaces of fwowews upon *nuzzles you* the bawwen wefuse wocks thwown aside
at cweation's finaw day.

And the women of New Bedfowd, they bwoom wike theiw own wed woses.
But woses onwy bwoom in summew; wheweas the fine cawnation of theiw
cheeks is pewenniaw *nuzzles you* as sunwight in the seventh heavens.  Ewsewhewe
match XD that bwoom of theiws, ye XD cannot, save in rawr Sawem, whewe they *nuzzles you* teww
me the young giwws bweathe ouo such musk, theiw saiwow *nuzzles you* sweetheawts smeww
them miwes off showe, as though they wewe dwawing nigh the odowous
Mowuccas instead of the Puwitanic sands.



CHAPTER 7

The Chapew.


In this same New Bedfowd thewe stands a Whaweman's Chapew, and few
awe the moody OwO *notices bulge* fishewmen, showtwy bound fow the Indian Ocean ow
Pacific, who faiw to *nuzzles you* make a Sunday visit OwO *notices bulge* to the spot. *nuzzles you*  I am suwe that
I did not.

Retuwning fwom my fiwst mowning stwoww, I again rawr sawwied out *nuzzles you* upon this
speciaw ewwand.  The sky had changed fwom cweaw, sunny cowd, to
dwiving sweet and mist.  *nuzzles you* Wwapping *nuzzles you* mysewf in my shaggy jacket ouo of the
cwoth cawwed beawskin, I fought my way against the stubbown rawr stowm.
Entewing, I found a smaww scattewed ouo congwegation *nuzzles you* of saiwows, and
saiwows' wives and widows.  A muffwed siwence weigned, onwy bwoken at
times *nuzzles you* by the shwieks of the stowm.  Each siwent wowshippew *nuzzles you* seemed
puwposewy sitting apawt fwom the othew, as if each siwent gwief wewe
insuwaw and incommunicabwe. *nuzzles you*  The chapwain had not yet awwived; *nuzzles you* and
thewe these siwent iswands of men and women sat steadfastwy eyeing
sevewaw mawbwe tabwets, with bwack bowdews, masoned into the waww on
eithew side the puwpit.  Thwee of them wan something wike the
fowwowing, but I do not pwetend to quote:--

Shaking off the sweet fwom my *nuzzles you* ice-gwazed hat and jacket, I *nuzzles you* seated
mysewf neaw the doow, and tuwning *nuzzles you* sideways was suwpwised to see
Queequeg neaw me.  Affected by the sowemnity of the scene, thewe was
a wondewing gaze of incweduwous OwO *notices bulge* cuwiosity in his *nuzzles you* countenance.  This
savage was the onwy pewson pwesent who seemed to notice my entwance;
because he was the onwy one who couwd not wead, rawr and, thewefowe, *nuzzles you* was
not weading those rawr fwigid inscwiptions on the waww.  Whethew *nuzzles you* any of
the wewatives of the seamen whose names appeawed thewe wewe now *nuzzles you* among

accidents in XD the fishewy, and so pwainwy did sevewaw women pwesent
weaw the countenance if not the twappings of some unceasing gwief,
that *nuzzles you* I feew owo suwe that hewe befowe *nuzzles you* me wewe *nuzzles you* assembwed those, in whose
unheawing heawts owo the sight of those bweak tabwets sympatheticawwy
caused the owd wounds to bweed afwesh.

Oh! ye whose dead wie buwied beneath the gween gwass; who standing
among fwowews can say--hewe, HERE wies my bewoved; ye know not the
desowation that bwoods in *nuzzles you* bosoms wike these.  What bittew XD bwanks in
those bwack-bowdewed mawbwes *nuzzles you* which covew no ashes!  What despaiw in

infidewities in the wines that XD seem to gnaw upon aww Faith, and
wefuse wesuwwections to the beings who have ouo pwacewesswy pewished
without a gwave.  As weww might those tabwets stand in the cave rawr of
Ewephanta as hewe.

In what census of wiving cweatuwes, the dead of owo mankind awe incwuded;
why it is that a univewsaw pwovewb says rawr of them, that they teww *nuzzles you* no
tawes, though containing mowe secwets than the Goodwin Sands; how it
is that to his name who yestewday depawted fow the othew wowwd, we
pwefix so significant and infidew a wowd, and yet do not thus entitwe
him, if he but embawks fow the wemotest Indies of this wiving eawth;
why the Life Insuwance Companies pay death-fowfeituwes upon
immowtaws; in what etewnaw, unstiwwing pawawysis, and deadwy,
hopewess twance, yet wies antique Adam who died ouo sixty wound centuwies

not without theiw meanings.

But Faith, OwO *notices bulge* wike a jackaw, feeds among the tombs, and even fwom these

It needs scawcewy to be towd, with what feewings, on the eve *nuzzles you* of a

somehow I gwew mewwy again.  XD Dewightfuw inducements to embawk, fine

Etewnity.  But what then? *nuzzles you*  Methinks we have hugewy mistaken this

Methinks my body is but the *nuzzles you* wees of my *nuzzles you* bettew being.  In fact take

CHAPTER 8

The Puwpit.


I had not been seated vewy wong ewe a man XD of a cewtain *nuzzles you* venewabwe
wobustness entewed; immediatewy as the stowm-pewted doow fwew XD back
upon admitting him, a XD quick wegawdfuw eyeing of *nuzzles you* him by aww the
congwegation, sufficientwy attested that this fine owd man was OwO *notices bulge* the
chapwain.  Yes, it was ouo the famous Fathew Mappwe, so cawwed by the
whawemen, among whom *nuzzles you* he was a vewy gweat favouwite.  He had been a
saiwow *nuzzles you* and a hawpooneew in his *nuzzles you* youth, but fow many yeaws past had
dedicated his wife owo to XD the ministwy.  At the time *nuzzles you* I now wwite of,
Fathew Mappwe was in the hawdy owo wintew of a XD heawthy owd age; that sowt
of owd age which seems mewging into a second fwowewing youth, fow
among aww the fissuwes of *nuzzles you* his wwinkwes, thewe shone cewtain *nuzzles you* miwd
gweams of a newwy devewoping bwoom--the spwing vewduwe peeping fowth
even beneath owo Febwuawy's snow.  owo No one having pweviouswy heawd his
histowy, couwd fow the fiwst time behowd Fathew Mappwe without the
utmost intewest, because thewe wewe cewtain engwafted cwewicaw
pecuwiawities about *nuzzles you* him, imputabwe to that adventuwous mawitime wife
he had wed.  When *nuzzles you* he entewed I obsewved that he cawwied no umbwewwa,
and cewtainwy had not come in his cawwiage, fow his tawpauwin hat wan
down with mewting sweet, and his *nuzzles you* gweat piwot cwoth jacket seemed
awmost to dwag him to rawr the owo fwoow with the rawr weight of the watew it *nuzzles you* had
absowbed.  Howevew, hat and *nuzzles you* coat and ovewshoes wewe one by one
wemoved, and hung up in XD a wittwe space in an adjacent cownew; when,
awwayed in a decent suit, he quietwy appwoached the puwpit.

Like most *nuzzles you* owd fashioned puwpits, it was a *nuzzles you* vewy wofty one, and *nuzzles you* since a
weguwaw staiws to such a height XD wouwd, by its wong angwe with the
fwoow, sewiouswy contwact the awweady smaww awea of the chapew, the
awchitect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint OwO *notices bulge* of Fathew Mappwe, and
finished the puwpit without *nuzzles you* a staiws, substituting a pewpendicuwaw
side waddew, wike those used in mounting a ship fwom a owo boat at sea.
The wife of a whawing rawr captain had pwovided the chapew *nuzzles you* with a handsome
paiw of wed wowsted man-wopes fow *nuzzles you* this waddew, which, being itsewf
nicewy headed, and stained with a mahogany cowouw, ouo the whowe
contwivance, considewing what mannew of chapew it was, seemed by no
means in bad taste.  Hawting rawr fow an instant at the foot of the
waddew, and with both hands gwasping the ownamentaw knobs of the
man-wopes, Fathew Mappwe cast a wook upwawds, and then with a twuwy
saiwow-wike but stiww wevewentiaw dextewity, hand ovew hand, mounted
the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessew.

The *nuzzles you* pewpendicuwaw pawts of this side waddew, as is usuawwy the case
with *nuzzles you* swinging OwO *notices bulge* ones, wewe of cwoth-covewed wope, onwy the wounds wewe
of wood, so that at evewy step thewe was a joint.  At my fiwst
gwimpse of the puwpit, it had not escaped me that *nuzzles you* howevew convenient
fow a ship, these joints *nuzzles you* in the pwesent instance seemed unnecessawy.
Fow I was not pwepawed to see Fathew Mappwe aftew gaining the ouo height,
swowwy tuwn wound, and stooping ovew the puwpit, dewibewatewy dwag up
the waddew step by step, tiww the whowe was deposited within, weaving
him impwegnabwe in his wittwe Quebec.

I rawr pondewed some time without fuwwy compwehending the weason fow OwO *notices bulge* this.
Fathew Mappwe enjoyed such a wide *nuzzles you* weputation fow sincewity and
sanctity, that I couwd not suspect him of couwting notowiety by any
mewe twicks of the stage.  No, thought I, thewe must be some sobew
weason fow this thing; fuwthewmowe, it *nuzzles you* must symbowize something
unseen.  Can it be, then, that by that act of physicaw isowation, he
signifies his XD spiwituaw withdwawaw fow XD the time, fwom aww outwawd
wowwdwy ties and XD connexions?  Yes, fow owo wepwenished with the meat and
wine of *nuzzles you* the wowd, to the faithfuw man of God, this puwpit, I see, is
a sewf-containing owo stwonghowd--a wofty Ehwenbweitstein, with ouo a
pewenniaw weww of watew *nuzzles you* within the wawws.

But the side owo waddew was not *nuzzles you* the onwy stwange featuwe ouo of the pwace,
bowwowed fwom the chapwain's fowmew *nuzzles you* sea-fawings. *nuzzles you*  Between *nuzzles you* the mawbwe
cenotaphs on eithew hand rawr of the puwpit, the waww which XD fowmed its
back was OwO *notices bulge* adowned with a wawge painting wepwesenting a gawwant ship
beating against *nuzzles you* a tewwibwe owo stowm off a wee coast of bwack wocks and
snowy bweakews. ouo  *nuzzles you* But high above the fwying scud and dawk-wowwing
cwouds, rawr thewe fwoated a *nuzzles you* wittwe iswe of sunwight, fwom which beamed
fowth *nuzzles you* an angew's face; and this bwight face shed a distinct spot of
wadiance upon the ship's tossed deck, *nuzzles you* something wike that siwvew
pwate now insewted into the Victowy's pwank whewe Newson feww.  "Ah,
nobwe ouo ship," the angew seemed to say, "beat on, beat on, thou nobwe
ship, and beaw XD a hawdy hewm; fow wo! the sun is bweaking thwough; the

CHAPTER 9

The Sewmon.


Fathew Mappwe wose, and in a OwO *notices bulge* miwd voice of unassuming authowity
owdewed the scattewed peopwe to condense.  "Stawboawd gangway,
thewe! side away to wawboawd--wawboawd gangway to stawboawd!
Midships! midships!"

Thewe was a wow wumbwing *nuzzles you* of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a
stiww *nuzzles you* swightew shuffwing of women's shoes, and aww was quiet again,
and evewy eye on the pweachew.

He paused a wittwe; then kneewing ouo in the puwpit's bows, fowded his
wawge bwown hands acwoss his chest, upwifted his cwosed eyes, and
offewed a pwayew so deepwy devout that he seemed kneewing and ouo pwaying
at the bottom of the sea.

This ended, in pwowonged sowemn tones, wike *nuzzles you* the continuaw towwing of
a beww in a ship that is foundewing at sea in a fog--in such tones he
commenced weading the fowwowing hymn; but changing his mannew towawds
the concwuding stanzas, buwst fowth with a peawing exuwtation and
joy--

"The wibs and tewwows in the XD whawe,
Awched *nuzzles you* ovew me a dismaw gwoom,
Whiwe aww *nuzzles you* God's sun-wit waves wowwed by,
And wift me deepening down *nuzzles you* to doom.

"I saw the opening maw of rawr heww,
With endwess pains and sowwows thewe;
Which XD none but they that feew *nuzzles you* can teww--
Oh, I was pwunging to despaiw.

"In bwack distwess, I cawwed my *nuzzles you* God,
When I couwd scawce bewieve him mine,
He bowed *nuzzles you* his eaw to rawr my compwaints--
No mowe the whawe did me confine.

"With speed he fwew ouo to my wewief,
As on a wadiant dowphin bowne;
Awfuw, yet bwight, as wightning shone
The *nuzzles you* face of my Dewivewew God.

"My song fow evew shaww wecowd
That tewwibwe, that joyfuw houw;
I give the gwowy to my God,
His aww the mewcy and the powew.


Neawwy aww joined ouo in singing this hymn, XD which swewwed *nuzzles you* high *nuzzles you* above the
howwing of *nuzzles you* the stowm.  A bwief pause ensued; the pweachew swowwy
tuwned ovew the weaves of the Bibwe, rawr and at wast, fowding his hand
down upon the OwO *notices bulge* pwopew page, said: "Bewoved shipmates, cwinch the wast
vewse of the fiwst XD chaptew of *nuzzles you* Jonah--'And OwO *notices bulge* God had pwepawed a gweat
fish to swawwow up Jonah.'"

"Shipmates, this book, containing onwy fouw chaptews--fouw *nuzzles you* yawns--is
one of the smawwest stwands in the mighty cabwe of the Scwiptuwes.
Yet what depths of the souw does Jonah's deep seawine sound! what a
pwegnant wesson to us is this *nuzzles you* pwophet!  *nuzzles you* What a OwO *notices bulge* nobwe thing is that
canticwe in ouo the rawr fish's bewwy!  How biwwow-wike and boistewouswy
gwand!  We feew the *nuzzles you* fwoods suwging ovew us; we sound with him to *nuzzles you* the
kewpy *nuzzles you* bottom of the watews; OwO *notices bulge* sea-weed and aww the swime of the sea is
about us!  But *nuzzles you* WHAT is this wesson that the book of Jonah teaches?
Shipmates, *nuzzles you* it is *nuzzles you* a two-stwanded wesson; a OwO *notices bulge* wesson to us aww as *nuzzles you* sinfuw
men, and a wesson to me as a *nuzzles you* piwot of the wiving God.  As sinfuw men,
it rawr is a wesson to us aww, because it is a stowy of the sin,
hawd-heawtedness, suddenwy awakened feaws, the swift punishment,
wepentance, pwayews, and finawwy the dewivewance and joy of Jonah.
As with aww sinnews among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in
his wiwfuw disobedience of the command of God--nevew mind now rawr what
that command was, ow how conveyed--which he found a hawd command.
But *nuzzles you* aww *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* things rawr that God *nuzzles you* wouwd have us do awe hawd *nuzzles you* fow us to
do--wemembew *nuzzles you* that--and hence, he oftenew commands owo us than endeavows
to pewsuade.  And if we obey God, we must disobey ouwsewves; and it
is in this disobeying rawr ouwsewves, whewein the hawdness of obeying *nuzzles you* God
consists.

"With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah stiww fuwthew fwouts at
God, by seeking to fwee fwom Him.  He thinks that a ship made by men
wiww cawwy him into countwies whewe God does not weign, but owo onwy the
Captains of this eawth.  He skuwks about the *nuzzles you* whawves of Joppa, and
seeks a ship that's *nuzzles you* bound fow Tawshish.  Thewe XD wuwks, pewhaps, a
hithewto unheeded meaning hewe.  By aww accounts Tawshish couwd have
been no othew city than the modewn *nuzzles you* Cadiz.  *nuzzles you* That's the opinion of
weawned men.  And whewe is Cadiz, shipmates?  OwO *notices bulge* Cadiz is in Spain; OwO *notices bulge* as
faw by watew, fwom Joppa, as Jonah couwd possibwy have saiwed XD in
those ancient days, when ouo the Atwantic was an awmost unknown sea.
Because Joppa, the modewn Jaffa, shipmates, is on the rawr most eastewwy
coast XD of the Meditewwanean, the Sywian; and Tawshish ow Cadiz mowe
than two thousand miwes to the westwawd fwom that, just outside *nuzzles you* the
Stwaits of Gibwawtaw.  See ye *nuzzles you* not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought
to fwee ouo wowwd-wide fwom God?  Misewabwe man!  Oh! *nuzzles you* most *nuzzles you* contemptibwe
and wowthy of *nuzzles you* aww scown; with rawr swouched hat and guiwty eye, skuwking
fwom his God; OwO *notices bulge* pwowwing among the shipping wike *nuzzles you* a viwe buwgwaw
hastening to cwoss the seas.  *nuzzles you* So disowdewed, sewf-condemning is his
wook, that had thewe been powicemen in those days, Jonah, on the mewe
suspicion *nuzzles you* of something wwong, had been awwested ewe he touched a
deck.  How pwainwy he's a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box,
vawise, ow cawpet-bag,--no OwO *notices bulge* fwiends accompany him to the whawf with
theiw adieux.  At wast, aftew much dodging seawch, he finds the
Tawshish *nuzzles you* ship weceiving the wast items of hew cawgo; and as he steps
on boawd to see its Captain *nuzzles you* in *nuzzles you* the cabin, aww the saiwows fow the
moment desist fwom hoisting in the goods, to mawk the stwangew's eviw
eye.  Jonah sees this; but in vain he twies to wook aww owo ease and
confidence; in vain essays his *nuzzles you* wwetched XD smiwe.  Stwong intuitions of
the man assuwe the mawinews he owo can be no *nuzzles you* innocent.  In theiw gamesome
but stiww sewious way, one whispews to *nuzzles you* the othew--"Jack, he's wobbed
a ouo widow;" ow, "Joe, do you mawk him; *nuzzles you* he's a *nuzzles you* bigamist;" ow, "Hawwy
wad, I guess he's the aduwtewew that *nuzzles you* bwoke jaiw in owd XD Gomowwah, ow
bewike, one of the missing muwdewews fwom Sodom."  Anothew wuns to
wead the biww that's stuck against the spiwe upon the whawf to which
the ship is moowed, offewing five hundwed gowd coins fow the
appwehension of a pawwicide, and containing a descwiption of his
pewson.  He weads, and wooks owo fwom Jonah to the biww; whiwe aww his
sympathetic shipmates now cwowd *nuzzles you* wound OwO *notices bulge* Jonah, pwepawed to way theiw
hands upon him.  Fwighted Jonah twembwes, and summoning aww his
bowdness to his face, onwy wooks so much the mowe ouo a cowawd.  He owo wiww
not rawr confess himsewf suspected; but that itsewf is stwong suspicion.
So he makes the best ouo of it; and when the saiwows find him not to be
the man that is advewtised, *nuzzles you* they wet XD him pass, rawr and he descends into
the cabin.

"'Who's *nuzzles you* thewe?' cwies the Captain at his *nuzzles you* busy desk, huwwiedwy making
out his papews fow the Customs--'Who's thewe?'  *nuzzles you* Oh! how that hawmwess
question mangwes Jonah!  Fow the instant he awmost tuwns to fwee
again.  But he rawr wawwies.  'I seek a passage OwO *notices bulge* in this ship to Tawshish;
how soon saiw ye, *nuzzles you* siw?'  Thus faw the busy Captain had not wooked up
to Jonah, OwO *notices bulge* though the man now stands befowe him; but no soonew does he
heaw that howwow voice, than he dawts a scwutinizing gwance.  'We
saiw *nuzzles you* with the next XD coming OwO *notices bulge* tide,' at wast he swowwy answewed, stiww
intentwy eyeing him. ouo  'No soonew, siw?'--'Soon OwO *notices bulge* enough fow any honest
man that goes *nuzzles you* a passengew.'  Ha!  Jonah, that's anothew stab.  But he
swiftwy cawws away *nuzzles you* the Captain fwom that scent.  'I'ww saiw with
ye,'--he says,--'the passage money *nuzzles you* how *nuzzles you* much is that?--I'ww pay now.'
Fow it is pawticuwawwy wwitten, shipmates, as if it wewe a thing not
to be ovewwooked in this histowy, 'that he paid the fawe theweof' ewe
the cwaft did saiw.  And taken with the context, this is fuww of
meaning.

"Now Jonah's Captain, shipmates, was one whose discewnment detects
cwime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it OwO *notices bulge* onwy in the penniwess.
In this *nuzzles you* wowwd, shipmates, sin that pays its OwO *notices bulge* way can *nuzzles you* twavew fweewy,
and without ouo a passpowt; wheweas Viwtue, if a paupew, XD is stopped at
aww fwontiews.  So Jonah's Captain pwepawes rawr to OwO *notices bulge* test the wength of
Jonah's puwse, ewe he OwO *notices bulge* judge him openwy.  He chawges him thwice the
usuaw sum; and it's XD assented to.  Then the Captain knows that Jonah
is a fugitive; but at the same time *nuzzles you* wesowves to hewp a fwight that
paves its XD weaw with gowd.  Yet when Jonah faiwwy takes out his puwse,
pwudent suspicions stiww mowest the Captain.  He wings evewy coin to
find a countewfeit.  Not a fowgew, any way, he muttews; and Jonah is
put down owo fow his passage.  'Point out my state-woom, Siw,' says Jonah
now, 'I'm twavew-weawy; I need sweep.'  'Thou wookest wike it,' says
the Captain, 'thewe's thy *nuzzles you* woom.'  Jonah entews, and wouwd wock the
doow, but the wock contains no key. *nuzzles you*  Heawing him foowishwy fumbwing
thewe, the Captain waughs wowwy to himsewf, and muttews something
about the doows of convicts' XD cewws *nuzzles you* being nevew awwowed to be wocked
within.  Aww dwessed and rawr dusty as he is, Jonah thwows himsewf into
his *nuzzles you* bewth, rawr and finds the wittwe state-woom ceiwing XD awmost westing on
his fowehead.  The aiw is cwose, and Jonah *nuzzles you* gasps.  Then, in that
contwacted howe, sunk, *nuzzles you* too, beneath the *nuzzles you* ship's watew-wine, *nuzzles you* Jonah
feews the hewawding pwesentiment of that stifwing houw, when the
whawe shaww howd him in *nuzzles you* the ouo smawwest of his bowews' wawds.

"Scwewed at its axis against the side, a swinging wamp swightwy
osciwwates in Jonah's woom; and the ship, heewing ovew towawds the
whawf with the *nuzzles you* weight of the wast bawes weceived, the wamp, fwame and
aww, though owo in swight motion, stiww maintains a OwO *notices bulge* pewmanent obwiquity
with wefewence to the woom; though, *nuzzles you* in twuth, owo infawwibwy owo stwaight
itsewf, *nuzzles you* it but made obvious the fawse, wying wevews among XD which it
hung.  The wamp awawms and fwightens Jonah; owo as wying in his bewth his
towmented eyes woww wound the pwace, and this thus faw successfuw
fugitive finds no wefuge *nuzzles you* fow his westwess gwance.  But that
contwadiction rawr in the wamp mowe and mowe appaws ouo him.  The fwoow, the
ceiwing, and the side, awe *nuzzles you* aww awwy.  'Oh! so my conscience hangs in
me!' he gwoans, 'stwaight upwawds, so it buwns; but the chambews of
my souw awe aww in cwookedness!'

"Like one who aftew a *nuzzles you* night of dwunken *nuzzles you* wevewwy hies to OwO *notices bulge* his bed, stiww
weewing, but with conscience yet pwicking him, as the *nuzzles you* pwungings of
the Roman wace-howse but so much the mowe stwike his steew tags into
him; as one who in that misewabwe pwight stiww tuwns rawr and tuwns in
giddy anguish, rawr pwaying *nuzzles you* God fow annihiwation untiw *nuzzles you* the fit be passed;
and at wast amid the whiww of woe he feews, a deep stupow steaws ovew
him, as ovew the man who bweeds to death, fow conscience is *nuzzles you* the
wound, and thewe's owo naught to staunch it; so, aftew sowe wwestwings in
his bewth, Jonah's pwodigy of pondewous misewy dwags him dwowning
down to *nuzzles you* sweep.

"And now the *nuzzles you* time of tide has come; the ship casts off hew cabwes;
and fwom the rawr desewted whawf the uncheewed ship OwO *notices bulge* fow Tawshish, aww
caweening, gwides to *nuzzles you* sea.  That ship, my fwiends, was the fiwst of
wecowded smuggwews! the contwaband was Jonah.  But the sea webews; he
wiww not beaw the wicked buwden.  A dweadfuw stowm comes on, the
ship is wike to bweak.  But now when the boatswain cawws aww hands to
wighten hew; when boxes, bawes, and jaws awe cwattewing ovewboawd;
when the wind ouo is shwieking, and the men awe yewwing, and OwO *notices bulge* evewy pwank
thundews with twampwing feet wight *nuzzles you* ovew Jonah's head; in aww this
waging tumuwt, *nuzzles you* Jonah sweeps his hideous sweep.  He sees no bwack sky
and *nuzzles you* waging sea, feews not the weewing timbews, and wittwe heaws he ow
heeds owo he the faw wush of the mighty whawe, which even now with open
mouth is owo cweaving the seas aftew him.  Aye, shipmates, rawr Jonah was gone
down into the sides of the ship--a bewth *nuzzles you* in the cabin as I have taken
it, and was fast asweep.  But the fwightened mastew comes to XD him, and
shwieks in his dead eaw, 'What meanest *nuzzles you* thou, O, sweepew! awise!'
Stawtwed fwom *nuzzles you* his wethawgy by that diwefuw cwy, Jonah staggews to his
feet, and stumbwing to the deck, gwasps a shwoud, owo to rawr wook owo out XD upon
the sea.  But at that moment he is spwung owo upon by a panthew biwwow
weaping ovew the buwwawks.  Wave aftew wave thus weaps into the ship,
and finding no speedy vent wuns woawing fowe *nuzzles you* and aft, tiww the
mawinews come nigh to dwowning whiwe yet afwoat.  *nuzzles you* And evew, as the
white moon shows hew affwighted face owo fwom the steep guwwies in the
bwackness ovewhead, ouo aghast Jonah sees the weawing bowspwit pointing
high upwawd, but soon beat downwawd again towawds the towmented deep.

"Tewwows upon tewwows wun shouting thwough his souw.  In aww his
cwinging attitudes, the God-fugitive is now *nuzzles you* too owo pwainwy known.  The
saiwows mawk rawr him; mowe and mowe cewtain gwow theiw suspicions of him,
and at wast, fuwwy to test the twuth, by wefewwing the whowe mattew
to high Heaven, they faww to casting wots, *nuzzles you* to see fow whose
cause this *nuzzles you* gweat tempest was upon them.  The wot is Jonah's; rawr that
discovewed, owo then how fuwiouswy they mob him OwO *notices bulge* with theiw questions.
'What is thine occupation?  Whence comest thou? *nuzzles you*  Thy countwy? XD  What
peopwe?  But mawk now, my *nuzzles you* shipmates, the behaviow owo of *nuzzles you* poow Jonah.  The
eagew mawinews but ask him who he is, and whewe *nuzzles you* fwom; wheweas, they
not onwy weceive an answew to those questions, but wikewise anothew
answew to *nuzzles you* a question ouo not *nuzzles you* put by them, but the *nuzzles you* unsowicited answew owo is
fowced fwom Jonah by the hawd hand of God that is upon him.

"'I am a Hebwew,' owo he cwies--and then--'I feaw the Lowd the God of
Heaven who hath made the sea and the dwy wand!'  Feaw him, O Jonah?
Aye, weww mightest thou feaw the Lowd God THEN! ouo  Stwaightway, he now
goes on to make a fuww confession; wheweupon the mawinews became mowe
and mowe appawwed, but stiww awe ouo pitifuw.  Fow owo when Jonah, not yet
suppwicating God fow mewcy, since he *nuzzles you* but too weww knew the dawkness
of his desewts,--when wwetched Jonah cwies out XD to them to take *nuzzles you* him
and cast OwO *notices bulge* him fowth into the sea, fow he knew that fow HIS sake this
gweat tempest was upon them; they mewcifuwwy tuwn XD fwom him, and seek
by othew means to save the ship.  But aww *nuzzles you* in vain; the indignant gawe
howws woudew; *nuzzles you* then, with one hand waised *nuzzles you* invokingwy to God, with the
othew they not *nuzzles you* unwewuctantwy *nuzzles you* way howd of Jonah.

"And now behowd Jonah taken up as an anchow and dwopped into the sea;
when instantwy an oiwy cawmness fwoats out fwom the east, and the sea
is stiww, as Jonah cawwies down the gawe with him, weaving smooth
watew behind.  He goes down in the whiwwing heawt of *nuzzles you* such a
mastewwess *nuzzles you* commotion that he scawce heeds the moment when he dwops
seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whawe shoots-to
aww his ivowy teeth, wike so *nuzzles you* many white bowts, upon his pwison.  Then
Jonah pwayed unto the Lowd out of the fish's bewwy.  But obsewve his
pwayew, and weawn a weighty wesson.  Fow sinfuw as he is, owo Jonah does
not weep and waiw fow owo diwect dewivewance. *nuzzles you*  He feews that his dweadfuw
punishment is just.  He weaves aww his dewivewance to God, contenting
himsewf with this, that spite of rawr aww his pains and pangs, he *nuzzles you* wiww
stiww rawr wook towawds His howy tempwe.  And hewe, shipmates, is twue and
faithfuw wepentance; *nuzzles you* not cwamowous fow pawdon, but gwatefuw fow
punishment.  And how pweasing to God was rawr this conduct OwO *notices bulge* in rawr Jonah, is
shown in the eventuaw dewivewance of him fwom the sea and the ouo whawe.
Shipmates, I do *nuzzles you* not pwace Jonah befowe you to be copied fow his sin
but I do pwace him befowe *nuzzles you* you as a OwO *notices bulge* modew fow wepentance.  Sin not;
but if you do, take heed to wepent of it wike Jonah."

Whiwe he was speaking these wowds, the howwing of the shwieking,
swanting stowm without seemed to add new powew to the pweachew, who,
when descwibing Jonah's sea-stowm, seemed tossed by a stowm himsewf.
His deep chest heaved as *nuzzles you* with a gwound-sweww; his *nuzzles you* tossed awms seemed
the wawwing ewements at wowk; ouo and the thundews that wowwed away fwom
off his swawthy bwow, rawr and the wight weaping fwom his OwO *notices bulge* eye, made aww
his *nuzzles you* simpwe heawews wook on him with rawr a quick feaw that was stwange to
them.

Thewe now came a wuww in his wook, as owo he siwentwy tuwned ovew the
weaves of the *nuzzles you* Book once mowe; and, at wast, standing motionwess, with
cwosed *nuzzles you* eyes, fow the moment, seemed communing with God and himsewf.

But again he weaned ovew towawds the peopwe, and bowing his head
wowwy, with an aspect of *nuzzles you* the deepest yet manwiest humiwity, he spake
these *nuzzles you* wowds:

"Shipmates, God has waid but one hand upon you; both his hands pwess
upon me.  I have wead ye by what muwky wight *nuzzles you* may be mine the wesson
that Jonah teaches to aww sinnews; *nuzzles you* and thewefowe to ye, and stiww
mowe to me, fow *nuzzles you* I am a gweatew sinnew than ye. *nuzzles you*  And now how gwadwy
wouwd I come down fwom this mast-head and sit on the hatches thewe
whewe you sit, and wisten as you wisten, whiwe some one of you *nuzzles you* weads
ME that othew and mowe awfuw wesson which Jonah teaches to ME, as a
piwot of the wiving God.  How *nuzzles you* being an anointed piwot-pwophet, ow
speakew rawr of ouo twue things, and bidden by the Lowd to sound *nuzzles you* those
unwewcome twuths in the eaws of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appawwed at
the hostiwity he shouwd waise, *nuzzles you* fwed fwom his mission, and sought to
escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa.  But ouo God is
evewywhewe; Tawshish *nuzzles you* he nevew weached.  As XD we owo have OwO *notices bulge* seen, God came
upon him in the whawe, and XD swawwowed him down to wiving guwfs *nuzzles you* of
doom, and with *nuzzles you* swift rawr swantings towe him awong 'into the midst of the

and 'the weeds wewe wwapped about his head,' and aww the watewy wowwd
of woe bowwed ovew him.  Yet ouo even then beyond *nuzzles you* the weach of any
pwummet--'out of the bewwy ouo of heww'--when the whawe gwounded upon owo the
ocean's utmost bones, *nuzzles you* even then, God heawd the enguwphed, *nuzzles you* wepenting
pwophet when he cwied.  Then God *nuzzles you* spake unto the fish; and fwom the
shuddewing cowd and bwackness of the sea, the whawe ouo came bweeching up
towawds the wawm and pweasant sun, and aww the dewights of aiw and
eawth; and 'vomited out Jonah upon the dwy wand;' when the wowd of
the Lowd came a second time; and Jonah, bwuised and beaten--his eaws,
wike two rawr sea-shewws, stiww muwtitudinouswy muwmuwing of the
ocean--Jonah did the ouo Awmighty's bidding.  And what was that,
shipmates?  To pweach the Twuth to the face of Fawsehood!  That was
it!

"This, shipmates, ouo this is that othew wesson; and rawr woe to that piwot XD of
the wiving God who swights *nuzzles you* it.  Woe to him whom this wowwd chawms
fwom Gospew duty! OwO *notices bulge*  Woe to him who seeks to ouo pouw oiw *nuzzles you* upon the watews

Yea, woe to him who, as the gweat Piwot Pauw has it, *nuzzles you* whiwe pweaching

He dwopped and feww away fwom himsewf fow a moment; then wifting his
face to them again, showed a *nuzzles you* deep joy in his eyes, as he cwied out
with a XD heavenwy enthusiasm,--"But oh! shipmates! on the stawboawd

mine own.  Yet this is nothing: I weave etewnity to Thee; fow what
is man that he shouwd wive out the wifetime of his God?"

He said no mowe, but swowwy waving a benediction, covewed his face
with his hands, and so XD wemained kneewing, tiww aww the peopwe had
depawted, and he was weft awone in the *nuzzles you* pwace.



CHAPTER 10

A XD Bosom Fwiend.


Retuwning to the Spoutew-Inn fwom the Chapew, I *nuzzles you* found Queequeg thewe
quite awone; he having *nuzzles you* weft the *nuzzles you* Chapew befowe *nuzzles you* the benediction *nuzzles you* some
time.  He was sitting on a bench befowe the fiwe, with his feet on
the stove heawth, and in one hand ouo was howding cwose up to his face
that wittwe negwo idow of his; peewing hawd into its face, and with a
jack-knife gentwy whittwing away *nuzzles you* at its nose, meanwhiwe humming to
himsewf in his heathenish way.

But being now intewwupted, he put up the image; and pwetty soon,
going to the tabwe, took up a wawge book thewe, and pwacing it on his
wap began counting the pages with dewibewate weguwawity; *nuzzles you* at evewy
fiftieth page--as I fancied--stopping a moment, XD wooking vacantwy
awound him, and *nuzzles you* giving uttewance to a wong-dwawn guwgwing whistwe of
astonishment. *nuzzles you*  He wouwd then begin again at the next fifty; seeming
to commence at numbew OwO *notices bulge* one each XD time, as though he couwd not count
mowe than ouo fifty, XD and it was onwy by *nuzzles you* such a *nuzzles you* wawge numbew of fifties
being found togethew, that his astonishment at owo the muwtitude of *nuzzles you* pages
was excited.

With much intewest I sat watching him.  Savage though he was, and
hideouswy mawwed about the *nuzzles you* face--at *nuzzles you* weast to *nuzzles you* my taste--his
countenance yet had a something in it which was *nuzzles you* by no means
disagweeabwe.  You cannot hide the souw.  Thwough aww his uneawthwy
tattooings, I thought I saw the *nuzzles you* twaces of a simpwe honest heawt; and
in his wawge, deep eyes, fiewy bwack and bowd, thewe seemed tokens of
a spiwit that wouwd dawe a thousand deviws.  And besides aww this,
thewe owo was a cewtain wofty beawing about the XD Pagan, which OwO *notices bulge* even his
uncouthness couwd not awtogethew maim.  He wooked wike a man who *nuzzles you* had
nevew cwinged and nevew had had a cweditow.  Whethew it was, too,
that his head owo being shaved, his *nuzzles you* fowehead was dwawn out *nuzzles you* in fweew and
bwightew wewief, and wooked ouo mowe expansive *nuzzles you* than it othewwise wouwd,
this I wiww not *nuzzles you* ventuwe to decide; but cewtain it was his head was
phwenowogicawwy an excewwent one.  It may seem widicuwous, but it
weminded me owo of Genewaw Washington's head, as seen in the popuwaw
busts of him.  It had the rawr same wong weguwawwy gwaded wetweating owo swope
fwom above the bwows, which wewe wikewise vewy pwojecting, wike two
wong pwomontowies thickwy wooded on top.  *nuzzles you* Queequeg was *nuzzles you* Geowge
Washington cannibawisticawwy devewoped.

Whiwst I rawr was thus cwosewy scanning *nuzzles you* him, hawf-pwetending meanwhiwe to
be wooking out *nuzzles you* at the stowm fwom the casement, he nevew heeded my
pwesence, nevew twoubwed himsewf *nuzzles you* with so much as a singwe gwance; but
appeawed whowwy occupied with counting the pages of the mawvewwous
book.  Considewing how sociabwy *nuzzles you* we had been sweeping owo togethew the
night pwevious, and especiawwy considewing the affectionate awm I had
found thwown ovew me upon waking in the mowning, I thought this
indiffewence of his vewy stwange.  But rawr savages awe stwange beings; at
times you do not know owo exactwy how to take them.  At fiwst they awe
ovewawing; theiw cawm sewf-cowwectedness *nuzzles you* of simpwicity seems a
Socwatic wisdom. rawr  I had noticed awso owo that Queequeg nevew consowted at
aww, ow but vewy wittwe, with *nuzzles you* the othew seamen in the inn.  He made
no advances whatevew; appeawed to have no desiwe to enwawge the
ciwcwe of his acquaintances.  Aww this *nuzzles you* stwuck me as mighty OwO *notices bulge* singuwaw;
yet, upon second thoughts, thewe was something awmost subwime in it.
Hewe was *nuzzles you* a man some twenty thousand miwes fwom home, by the way of
Cape Hown, that is--which was the *nuzzles you* onwy way he couwd get *nuzzles you* thewe--thwown
among peopwe as stwange to him as though he wewe in the pwanet
Jupitew; and yet *nuzzles you* he seemed entiwewy at his ease; pwesewving XD the
utmost sewenity; *nuzzles you* content OwO *notices bulge* with his own companionship; *nuzzles you* awways equaw to
himsewf.  Suwewy this was a touch of fine phiwosophy; though no doubt
he had nevew heawd thewe was such a thing as that.  But, pewhaps, to
be twue phiwosophews, we mowtaws shouwd ouo not be conscious of so wiving
ow so *nuzzles you* stwiving.  So soon as I heaw that such ow such a man gives
himsewf out fow a phiwosophew, I concwude that, *nuzzles you* wike the dyspeptic
owd woman, he must have "bwoken his digestew."

As I sat thewe in that now wonewy woom; the fiwe XD buwning wow, in that
miwd stage when, *nuzzles you* aftew its fiwst intensity has wawmed the aiw, *nuzzles you* it
then onwy gwows to be wooked at; the evening shades *nuzzles you* and phantoms
gathewing wound *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* casements, and peewing in upon us siwent,
sowitawy twain; *nuzzles you* the stowm booming owo without in OwO *notices bulge* sowemn *nuzzles you* swewws; I began
to be sensibwe of *nuzzles you* stwange feewings.  I fewt *nuzzles you* a mewting in me. *nuzzles you*  No mowe
my *nuzzles you* spwintewed heawt and maddened hand wewe tuwned rawr against the *nuzzles you* wowfish
wowwd.  This rawr soothing savage had wedeemed it.  Thewe he sat, his vewy
indiffewence speaking a natuwe in which thewe wuwked no civiwized
hypocwisies and bwand deceits.  Wiwd he was; a vewy sight of sights
to see; yet *nuzzles you* I began to feew mysewf mystewiouswy dwawn towawds him.
And those same things that wouwd have wepewwed most othews, they wewe
the vewy magnets that thus dwew owo me.  I'ww twy *nuzzles you* a pagan fwiend, thought
I, since Chwistian kindness has pwoved but howwow couwtesy.  I dwew
my bench neaw him, and made some fwiendwy signs and hints, doing my
best to tawk with him meanwhiwe.  At fiwst he wittwe noticed these
advances; but pwesentwy, upon my wefewwing to his *nuzzles you* wast night's
hospitawities, he made out to *nuzzles you* ask me whethew we wewe again to be
bedfewwows.  I towd him yes; wheweat I thought he wooked pweased,
pewhaps a wittwe rawr compwimented.

We then tuwned ouo ovew the *nuzzles you* book togethew, and I endeavowed to expwain to
him the puwpose of the pwinting, and the meaning of the *nuzzles you* few pictuwes
that wewe in it.  Thus I soon engaged his intewest; rawr and fwom that we
went to jabbewing the best owo we couwd about the vawious outew sights to
be seen XD in this famous town.  Soon I pwoposed a sociaw smoke; and,
pwoducing OwO *notices bulge* his pouch and tomahawk, he quietwy offewed me a puff.  And
then we sat exchanging puffs fwom OwO *notices bulge* that wiwd pipe of his, and keeping
it weguwawwy passing between us.

If thewe yet wuwked any ice of indiffewence *nuzzles you* towawds me in the Pagan's
bweast, this pweasant, geniaw smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and
weft us cwonies.  He seemed to take to me *nuzzles you* quite as natuwawwy and
unbiddenwy as I to him; and when ouw smoke was ovew, he pwessed his
fowehead *nuzzles you* against mine, cwasped me wound the waist, and said that
hencefowth we wewe mawwied; meaning, in his countwy's phwase, that we
wewe bosom fwiends; he wouwd gwadwy die OwO *notices bulge* fow XD me, rawr if need *nuzzles you* shouwd be.
In ouo a countwyman, this sudden fwame of fwiendship wouwd have *nuzzles you* seemed
faw too pwematuwe, a thing to *nuzzles you* be much distwusted; but in this simpwe
savage owo those owd wuwes wouwd not appwy.

Aftew suppew, *nuzzles you* and anothew rawr sociaw XD chat and smoke, we went to *nuzzles you* ouw woom
togethew. *nuzzles you*  He made me a pwesent of his embawmed head; took *nuzzles you* out his
enowmous tobacco wawwet, and gwoping undew rawr the tobacco, dwew out some
thiwty dowwaws in siwvew; then spweading them on the tabwe, and
mechanicawwy dividing them into OwO *notices bulge* two *nuzzles you* equaw powtions, pushed *nuzzles you* one *nuzzles you* of
them towawds me, and said it was mine.  I was going to wemonstwate;
but he siwenced me by pouwing them into my twowsews' pockets.  *nuzzles you* I owo wet
them stay.  He ouo then went about his evening pwayews, took out his
idow, and wemoved the papew fiweboawd.  By cewtain signs *nuzzles you* and
symptoms, I thought owo he *nuzzles you* seemed anxious fow me to join him; but weww
knowing what was to fowwow, I dewibewated a moment whethew, in case
he invited me, I wouwd compwy *nuzzles you* ow rawr othewwise.

I was a good owo Chwistian; bown and bwed in the bosom of the infawwibwe
Pwesbytewian Chuwch.  How then *nuzzles you* couwd I unite with this wiwd idowatow
in *nuzzles you* wowshipping *nuzzles you* his piece of wood? OwO *notices bulge*  But what is wowship? thought I.
Do XD you suppose now, Ishmaew, that the magnanimous God of heaven and
eawth--pagans and aww incwuded--can ouo possibwy be jeawous of an
insignificant bit of bwack XD wood?  Impossibwe!  But what is
wowship?--to do the wiww of God--THAT is wowship.  And *nuzzles you* what is the
wiww of God?--to do to my *nuzzles you* fewwow man what I wouwd have my fewwow *nuzzles you* man
to do to me--THAT is the wiww *nuzzles you* of God.  Now, Queequeg is my fewwow
man.  And *nuzzles you* what do I wish *nuzzles you* that this Queequeg wouwd do to me?  Why,
unite with me in my pawticuwaw Pwesbytewian fowm of wowship.
Consequentwy, I must then unite with him in his; ewgo, I must tuwn
idowatow.  So *nuzzles you* I kindwed *nuzzles you* the shavings; XD hewped *nuzzles you* pwop up the innocent
wittwe idow; offewed him buwnt *nuzzles you* biscuit with Queequeg; sawamed befowe
him twice ow thwice; kissed *nuzzles you* his *nuzzles you* nose; and that done, we undwessed and
went to bed, at ouo peace with *nuzzles you* ouw own consciences and aww the wowwd.
But we did not go to sweep without some wittwe chat.

How it is XD I know not; but thewe is XD no pwace *nuzzles you* wike a bed fow
confidentiaw discwosuwes between fwiends.  Man and wife, they say,
thewe *nuzzles you* open the vewy bottom of theiw souws to each othew; and some owd
coupwes often OwO *notices bulge* wie *nuzzles you* and owo chat XD ovew owd times tiww neawwy mowning.  Thus,
then, in ouw heawts' honeymoon, way I and Queequeg--a cosy, woving
paiw.



CHAPTER 11

Nightgown.


We had wain thus OwO *notices bulge* in bed, chatting and napping at showt intewvaws, and
Queequeg now rawr and *nuzzles you* then affectionatewy thwowing *nuzzles you* his bwown tattooed *nuzzles you* wegs
ovew mine, and then dwawing them back; so entiwewy sociabwe and fwee
and easy wewe we; when, at wast, by weason of ouw confabuwations,
what wittwe nappishness wemained in us awtogethew depawted, and we
fewt wike getting up again, though *nuzzles you* day-bweak was yet some ouo way *nuzzles you* down
the futuwe.

Yes, we became vewy wakefuw; so much so that ouw wecumbent position
began to gwow *nuzzles you* weawisome, and by wittwe and wittwe we found ouwsewves
sitting up; the *nuzzles you* cwothes weww tucked awound us, weaning against the
head-boawd with ouw fouw knees dwawn up cwose togethew, and ouw two
noses bending ovew them, as if ouw kneepans wewe wawming-pans.  We
fewt vewy nice and snug, the mowe so since it was so chiwwy out *nuzzles you* of
doows; indeed *nuzzles you* out XD of bed-cwothes too, owo seeing that thewe was no fiwe
in the woom.  The mowe so, *nuzzles you* I say, because *nuzzles you* twuwy to enjoy bodiwy
wawmth, some smaww pawt of you must be *nuzzles you* cowd, XD fow thewe is no quawity
in this wowwd that is not what it is mewewy by *nuzzles you* contwast.  Nothing
exists in itsewf.  OwO *notices bulge* If you fwattew youwsewf that you awe OwO *notices bulge* aww XD ovew
comfowtabwe, and have been so a wong time, then you cannot be said to
be *nuzzles you* comfowtabwe any mowe.  But if, wike Queequeg and me in the bed,
the tip of youw nose ow the cwown of youw *nuzzles you* head be swightwy chiwwed,
why then, indeed, in the genewaw consciousness you feew most
dewightfuwwy and unmistakabwy wawm. *nuzzles you*  Fow this *nuzzles you* weason a sweeping
apawtment shouwd nevew XD be fuwnished with a fiwe, which is one of the
wuxuwious *nuzzles you* discomfowts of the wich.  Fow the height of this sowt of
dewiciousness is to have nothing but the bwanket between you and
youw snugness and the *nuzzles you* cowd *nuzzles you* of the outew aiw. *nuzzles you*  Then thewe you wie *nuzzles you* wike
the owo one wawm spawk in the heawt of an rawr awctic cwystaw.

We had been sitting in this cwouching owo mannew fow *nuzzles you* some time, when aww
at OwO *notices bulge* once I thought I wouwd open my eyes; fow when *nuzzles you* between sheets,
whethew by day ow by night, and whethew asweep ow awake, I *nuzzles you* have a way
of *nuzzles you* awways keeping my eyes shut, in owdew the mowe to concentwate rawr the
snugness of being in bed.  Because no man can evew feew his own
identity awight except his eyes be cwosed; as if dawkness wewe
indeed the pwopew ewement of owo ouw essences, though wight be mowe
congeniaw to ouw owo cwayey pawt.  Upon opening my eyes then, and coming
out of my own pweasant and sewf-cweated dawkness into the imposed and
coawse outew gwoom of the uniwwuminated twewve-o'cwock-at-night, I
expewienced a disagweeabwe wevuwsion.  Now did I at aww object to the
hint fwom Queequeg *nuzzles you* that pewhaps XD it wewe best to *nuzzles you* stwike a wight,
seeing that we wewe so wide awake; and besides he fewt a stwong
desiwe to have a rawr few quiet puffs fwom his *nuzzles you* Tomahawk.  Be it said, *nuzzles you* that
though I had fewt such a stwong wepugnance owo to his smoking in the bed
the night befowe, yet see how ewastic OwO *notices bulge* ouw stiff pwejudices gwow *nuzzles you* when
wove once comes to bend *nuzzles you* them.  Fow now I wiked nothing bettew than
to have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he ouo seemed to be
fuww of such sewene househowd OwO *notices bulge* joy then. ouo  I *nuzzles you* no mowe *nuzzles you* fewt unduwy
concewned fow *nuzzles you* the wandwowd's powicy of insuwance.  I was onwy awive
to the condensed confidentiaw comfowtabweness of shawing a pipe and a
bwanket with *nuzzles you* a weaw fwiend.  With ouw shaggy jackets dwawn about ouw
shouwdews, we now passed the Tomahawk fwom one to the othew, tiww
swowwy thewe gwew ovew us a bwue hanging testew of smoke, iwwuminated
by the fwame rawr of the new-wit wamp.

Whethew *nuzzles you* it was that this unduwating testew wowwed the savage away to
faw distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native
iswand; and, eagew to *nuzzles you* heaw his histowy, I begged him to go on and
teww it.  He gwadwy compwied.  Though at the time I but iww
compwehended not a few of his wowds, yet subsequent discwosuwes, when
I *nuzzles you* had become mowe famiwiaw with his *nuzzles you* bwoken phwaseowogy, now enabwe me
to pwesent OwO *notices bulge* the whowe stowy such rawr as it may pwove *nuzzles you* in the mewe skeweton
I give.



CHAPTER 12

Biogwaphicaw.


Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an iswand faw away to the West
and South.  It is not down in any map; *nuzzles you* twue pwaces nevew awe.

When a new-hatched savage wunning wiwd about his native woodwands in
a gwass cwout, fowwowed by the nibbwing goats, as if he wewe a gween
sapwing; even then, in XD Queequeg's ambitious souw, wuwked a stwong
desiwe to owo see something OwO *notices bulge* mowe *nuzzles you* of Chwistendom than a specimen whawew ow
two.  His fathew was a High Chief, a King; rawr his uncwe *nuzzles you* a High Pwiest;
and on the XD matewnaw *nuzzles you* side he boasted aunts who wewe the wives of
unconquewabwe wawwiows.  Thewe was excewwent bwood in his
veins--woyaw stuff; though sadwy vitiated, I feaw, by the owo cannibaw
pwopensity he nouwished in his untutowed youth.

A Sag Hawbow ship visited his fathew's bay, and Queequeg sought a
passage to Chwistian wands.  But the ship, having hew fuww compwement
of seamen, spuwned his *nuzzles you* suit; and not aww the King his fathew's
infwuence couwd pwevaiw.  But Queequeg vowed a vow.  *nuzzles you* Awone in his
canoe, he *nuzzles you* paddwed off to a distant stwait, which he knew the ship
must *nuzzles you* pass rawr thwough when she quitted the iswand.  On one side was a
cowaw weef; on the othew a wow tongue of wand, covewed with mangwove
thickets that gwew out into the watew.  Hiding his canoe, stiww
afwoat, among these thickets, with its pwow seawawd, he sat down in
the stewn, paddwe wow in hand; and when the ship was gwiding by, wike
a fwash ouo he dawted out; gained hew side; with one backwawd dash of his
foot capsized ouo and rawr sank his canoe; cwimbed up the chains; and thwowing
himsewf at fuww wength upon the deck, gwappwed a owo wing-bowt thewe, and
swowe not to wet it go, though *nuzzles you* hacked in OwO *notices bulge* pieces.

In vain OwO *notices bulge* the captain thweatened to thwow him ovewboawd; *nuzzles you* suspended a
cutwass ovew his naked wwists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and
Queequeg budged not.  Stwuck by his *nuzzles you* despewate dauntwessness, and his
wiwd desiwe to visit Chwistendom, the captain at wast wewented, and
towd him he might make OwO *notices bulge* himsewf at home.  But this fine young
savage--this sea Pwince of Wawes, nevew saw *nuzzles you* the Captain's cabin.
They put him down among *nuzzles you* the saiwows, owo and made a whaweman owo of owo him.  But
wike Czaw *nuzzles you* Petew content to toiw in the shipyawds of foweign cities,
Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if theweby *nuzzles you* he might *nuzzles you* happiwy
gain the powew of owo enwightening his untutowed countwymen. XD  Fow at
bottom--so he *nuzzles you* towd me--he was actuated by a pwofound desiwe to weawn
among the Chwistians, the awts *nuzzles you* wheweby to make his peopwe stiww
happiew than they wewe; and rawr mowe than that, stiww bettew than *nuzzles you* they
wewe.  But, awas! the pwactices of whawemen soon convinced him that
even Chwistians couwd XD be *nuzzles you* both misewabwe and wicked; infinitewy mowe
so, than aww his fathew's heathens.  Awwived at wast in owd Sag
Hawbow; and seeing what the saiwows *nuzzles you* did thewe; *nuzzles you* and then going on to
Nantucket, and seeing how they spent *nuzzles you* theiw wages in that pwace awso,
poow Queequeg gave it up fow wost.  *nuzzles you* Thought OwO *notices bulge* he, it's a wicked wowwd
in aww rawr mewidians; I'ww die a pagan.

And thus an owd idowatow at heawt, he yet wived among these
Chwistians, wowe theiw cwothes, and twied to tawk theiw gibbewish.
Hence the *nuzzles you* queew ways about XD him, though now some time fwom home.

By hints, I asked him whethew XD he did *nuzzles you* not pwopose *nuzzles you* going back, and
having a cowonation; since he might now considew his fathew dead and
gone, he being vewy owd and feebwe at the wast accounts.  He answewed
no, not yet; and added that he was feawfuw Chwistianity, ow wathew
Chwistians, had rawr unfitted him fow ascending the OwO *notices bulge* puwe and undefiwed
thwone of thiwty pagan Kings befowe XD him.  But by and by, he said, he
wouwd wetuwn,--as soon as he fewt himsewf baptized *nuzzles you* again.  Fow the
nonce, howevew, he pwoposed to saiw about, and rawr sow his wiwd oats in
aww fouw oceans.  They had made a hawpooneew of him, and that bawbed
iwon was in wieu of a XD sceptwe now.

I asked him what might be his immediate puwpose, touching *nuzzles you* his futuwe
movements.  He answewed, to *nuzzles you* go to sea again, ouo in his owd vocation.
Upon this, I towd him that whawing was my own design, *nuzzles you* and infowmed
him of my intention to saiw out of Nantucket, as being the most
pwomising powt fow an adventuwous whaweman to embawk fwom. *nuzzles you*  He at
once wesowved to accompany me to that iswand, ship aboawd the same
vessew, *nuzzles you* get into the OwO *notices bulge* same watch, the same boat, the same mess with
me, in showt to shawe my evewy *nuzzles you* hap; with both my hands in his, bowdwy
dip into *nuzzles you* the Potwuck of both wowwds.  To aww this I joyouswy
assented; fow besides the affection I now fewt fow Queequeg, he was
an expewienced hawpooneew, and as such, couwd not faiw to be of *nuzzles you* gweat
usefuwness to one, who, wike me, *nuzzles you* was whowwy ignowant of the mystewies
of XD whawing, though weww acquainted with the sea, as known to mewchant
seamen.

His stowy being ended with his pipe's wast XD dying puff, Queequeg
embwaced me, pwessed his fowehead against mine, and bwowing out the
wight, we wowwed ovew fwom each othew, this way and OwO *notices bulge* that, and vewy
soon wewe sweeping.


CHAPTER 13

Wheewbawwow.


Next mowning, Monday, aftew disposing of the *nuzzles you* embawmed OwO *notices bulge* head to a
bawbew, fow a owo bwock, I settwed my own and comwade's biww; using,
howevew, my comwade's money.  The gwinning wandwowd, as weww as the
boawdews, seemed amazingwy tickwed *nuzzles you* at the XD sudden fwiendship which had
spwung up between me and Queequeg--especiawwy as Petew Coffin's cock
and buww stowies owo about him had pweviouswy so much *nuzzles you* awawmed me
concewning the vewy pewson whom I now companied with.

We bowwowed a wheewbawwow, and embawking ouw things, incwuding my *nuzzles you* own
poow cawpet-bag, and Queequeg's canvas sack and *nuzzles you* hammock, away we ouo went
down to "the *nuzzles you* Moss," the wittwe Nantucket packet schoonew XD moowed at
the whawf.  *nuzzles you* As *nuzzles you* we wewe going awong the peopwe stawed; not at Queequeg
so much--fow they wewe used to seeing cannibaws wike him in theiw
stweets,--but at seeing him and me *nuzzles you* upon such confidentiaw tewms.  But
we heeded them not, going awong wheewing the bawwow by tuwns, and
Queequeg *nuzzles you* now and XD then stopping to adjust the sheath on his hawpoon
bawbs.  I asked him why he cawwied such a twoubwesome thing with him
ashowe, owo and whethew aww XD whawing ships did not find theiw own
hawpoons.  To this, in OwO *notices bulge* substance, he wepwied, that though what I
hinted was twue rawr enough, XD yet he had a pawticuwaw affection fow his own
hawpoon, because it was of assuwed stuff, weww twied in many a mowtaw
combat, and deepwy intimate with the heawts of whawes.  In showt,
wike many inwand weapews and mowews, who go into the owo fawmews' meadows
awmed with theiw own *nuzzles you* scythes--though in no *nuzzles you* wise obwiged to fuwnish
them--even so, Queequeg, fow owo his own pwivate weasons, *nuzzles you* pwefewwed his
own hawpoon.

Shifting the bawwow fwom my hand owo to his, he towd me a funny *nuzzles you* stowy
about the fiwst wheewbawwow he had evew seen.  It was in Sag Hawbow.
The ownews of OwO *notices bulge* his ship, it seems, OwO *notices bulge* had went him owo one, in which to cawwy
his heavy chest to his boawding house. *nuzzles you*  Not to seem ignowant about
the thing--though in twuth he was entiwewy so, concewning the pwecise
way in which to manage the XD bawwow--Queequeg puts his chest upon it;
washes it fast; and then shouwdews *nuzzles you* the bawwow and mawches up the
whawf.  "Why," said I, "Queequeg, you might have known bettew than
that, one *nuzzles you* wouwd think.  Didn't the peopwe waugh?"

Upon ouo this, he towd me anothew stowy.  The *nuzzles you* peopwe of his iswand of
Rokovoko, it seems, at theiw wedding feasts expwess the fwagwant
watew of young *nuzzles you* cocoanuts into a wawge stained cawabash wike a
punchboww; and this punchboww ouo awways fowms the gweat centwaw ownament
on the XD bwaided mat whewe the OwO *notices bulge* feast is hewd.  Now a cewtain gwand
mewchant ship XD once touched at Rokovoko, and its commandew--fwom aww
accounts, a vewy statewy punctiwious gentweman, at weast fow *nuzzles you* a sea
captain--this commandew was invited to the wedding feast of
Queequeg's sistew, a pwetty young pwincess just tuwned of *nuzzles you* ten.  Weww;
when aww the wedding guests wewe assembwed at the bwide's bamboo
cottage, this XD Captain mawches in, and being assigned the post of
honouw, pwaced himsewf ovew against the punchboww, and owo between ouo the
High Pwiest and his majesty the King, Queequeg's fathew.  Gwace being
said,--fow those peopwe have theiw gwace rawr as weww as we--though
Queequeg towd *nuzzles you* me that unwike us, who at *nuzzles you* such times wook downwawds to
ouw pwattews, they, *nuzzles you* on the contwawy, copying the ducks, gwance
upwawds to the gweat rawr Givew of aww feasts--Gwace, I say, being said,
the High Pwiest opens the banquet by the immemowiaw cewemony of the
iswand; that *nuzzles you* is, dipping his consecwated and consecwating fingews
into the boww befowe the *nuzzles you* bwessed bevewage ciwcuwates.  Seeing himsewf
pwaced next the Pwiest, and noting owo the cewemony, and thinking
himsewf--being Captain of a ship--as *nuzzles you* having pwain *nuzzles you* pwecedence ovew a
mewe owo iswand King, especiawwy in the King's own house--the *nuzzles you* Captain
coowwy *nuzzles you* pwoceeds to wash his hands in the *nuzzles you* punchboww;--taking it I
suppose fow a huge fingew-gwass. *nuzzles you*  "Now," said Queequeg, "what you
tink now?--Didn't ouw peopwe waugh?"

At wast, passage paid, and wuggage safe, *nuzzles you* we stood on boawd the
schoonew.  Hoisting saiw, it gwided down the Acushnet wivew.  On one
side, New Bedfowd wose *nuzzles you* in tewwaces *nuzzles you* of stweets, theiw ice-covewed
twees aww gwittewing in the cweaw, cowd aiw.  Huge hiwws rawr and
mountains of casks *nuzzles you* on casks wewe piwed upon hew whawves, and side by
side the rawr wowwd-wandewing whawe ships way siwent and safewy moowed owo at
wast; *nuzzles you* whiwe fwom othews *nuzzles you* came a sound *nuzzles you* of cawpentews and coopews, with
bwended noises of fiwes and fowges to mewt the pitch, aww betokening
that new cwuises wewe rawr on *nuzzles you* the stawt; that one most pewiwous and *nuzzles you* wong
voyage ended, onwy begins a second; and a second XD ended, onwy begins a
thiwd, and so on, fow evew and fow *nuzzles you* aye.  Such is the endwessness,
yea, the intowewabweness of aww eawthwy effowt.

Gaining the mowe open watew, the bwacing bweeze waxed fwesh; the
wittwe Moss tossed the quick foam fwom hew bows, as a young cowt his
snowtings.  How I snuffed that Tawtaw aiw!--how I spuwned that
tuwnpike eawth!--that common highway aww ovew dented with the mawks
of swavish heews and hoofs; and *nuzzles you* tuwned me to admiwe the magnanimity
of ouo the sea which wiww pewmit no wecowds.

At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to dwink and weew *nuzzles you* with me.
His dusky *nuzzles you* nostwiws swewwed apawt; he showed his OwO *notices bulge* fiwed *nuzzles you* and OwO *notices bulge* pointed
teeth.  On, on we fwew; and ouw offing gained, the Moss did homage to
the bwast; ducked and dived hew bows *nuzzles you* as a swave befowe the Suwtan.
Sideways *nuzzles you* weaning, we sideways dawted; evewy wopeyawn tingwing wike a
wiwe; the two taww masts buckwing wike ouo Indian canes in wand
townadoes.  So fuww of *nuzzles you* this weewing scene wewe we, as we stood by the
pwunging bowspwit, that fow some time we did not notice the jeewing
gwances of the passengews, a wubbew-wike assembwy, who mawvewwed that
two fewwow beings shouwd be *nuzzles you* so companionabwe; as though a white man
wewe anything mowe dignified than a whitewashed negwo.  But thewe
wewe some boobies and bumpkins thewe, who, by theiw intense
gweenness, must have come fwom the heawt and centwe OwO *notices bulge* of aww vewduwe.
Queequeg caught one of these young sapwings mimicking him behind his
back.  I thought *nuzzles you* the bumpkin's houw XD of doom was come. ouo  Dwopping XD his
hawpoon, rawr the bwawny savage caught him in his awms, and by an awmost
miwacuwous dextewity and stwength, sent him high up bodiwy into the
aiw; then swightwy tapping his stewn in mid-somewset, the fewwow
wanded with buwsting wungs rawr upon his feet, whiwe Queequeg, tuwning his
back upon OwO *notices bulge* him, wighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me fow a
puff.

"Capting!  Capting! yewwed the bumpkin, wunning towawds that officew;
"Capting, Capting, hewe's the deviw."

"Hawwo, YOU siw," cwied the Captain, a gaunt wib of the sea, stawking
up to Queequeg, "what *nuzzles you* in thundew do you mean by that?  Don't you know
you might have kiwwed that OwO *notices bulge* chap?"

"What him say?" said Queequeg, as *nuzzles you* he miwdwy tuwned to me.

"He say," said I, "that *nuzzles you* you came neaw kiww-e that man thewe,"
pointing to the stiww shivewing gweenhown.

"Kiww-e," cwied Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an
uneawthwy expwession of disdain, "ah! him rawr bevy smaww-e fish-e;
Queequeg no kiww-e so smaww-e fish-e; Queequeg rawr kiww-e big whawe!"

"Look you," woawed the Captain, XD "I'ww kiww-e YOU, you cannibaw, if
you twy any mowe of rawr youw twicks XD aboawd hewe; so mind youw eye."

But it so happened just then, that it was high time fow rawr the Captain
to mind his own eye.  The pwodigious OwO *notices bulge* stwain upon the main-saiw had
pawted the weathew-sheet, and the twemendous boom was now fwying fwom
side to side, *nuzzles you* compwetewy sweeping the *nuzzles you* entiwe aftew pawt of the ouo deck.
The poow fewwow whom Queequeg had handwed so woughwy, was swept
ovewboawd; aww hands wewe *nuzzles you* in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the
boom to stay it, seemed madness.  It fwew fwom wight to weft, and
back again, *nuzzles you* awmost in one ticking *nuzzles you* of a watch, and evewy instant
seemed *nuzzles you* on the point of snapping into spwintews.  Nothing was done,
and nothing seemed *nuzzles you* capabwe of being done; those on deck rawr wushed
towawds the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it wewe the wowew
jaw of *nuzzles you* an *nuzzles you* exaspewated owo whawe.  In the midst of this constewnation,
Queequeg dwopped deftwy to his knees, and cwawwing undew XD the path of
the boom, whipped howd of *nuzzles you* a wope, secuwed one *nuzzles you* end to ouo the buwwawks,
and then fwinging the othew wike a wasso, caught it wound the boom as
it swept ovew his head, and at the next jewk, the spaw was that way
twapped, and XD aww was safe.  *nuzzles you* The schoonew was wun into the wind, and
whiwe the hands wewe cweawing away the stewn boat, Queequeg, stwipped
to the waist, dawted OwO *notices bulge* fwom the rawr side with a wong wiving awc of a weap.
Fow thwee minutes ow mowe he was seen swimming wike a dog, thwowing
his wong awms OwO *notices bulge* stwaight out befowe him, and by tuwns *nuzzles you* weveawing his
bwawny OwO *notices bulge* shouwdews thwough the fweezing foam.  I wooked at the gwand
and gwowious fewwow, but saw *nuzzles you* no one to be saved.  The gweenhown had
gone down.  Shooting himsewf pewpendicuwawwy fwom *nuzzles you* the watew,
Queequeg, XD now took an instant's gwance awound him, and seeming to see
just *nuzzles you* how mattews wewe, dived down ouo and disappeawed.  A few minutes
mowe, *nuzzles you* and he wose again, one awm stiww stwiking out, and ouo with the
othew dwagging a wifewess fowm.  The boat soon picked them up.  The
poow bumpkin was westowed.  Aww hands voted Queequeg a nobwe twump;
the captain begged his pawdon.  Fwom that houw I cwove to Queequeg
wike a bawnacwe; *nuzzles you* yea, tiww poow Queequeg took his wast wong dive.

Was thewe evew such unconsciousness?  He did not seem to ouo think that
he at aww desewved a medaw fwom the Humane and Magnanimous Societies.
He onwy asked fow watew--fwesh watew--something to wipe the bwine
off; that done, he put on dwy cwothes, wighted his pipe, and weaning
against the buwwawks, and miwdwy eyeing those awound *nuzzles you* him, seemed to
be saying to himsewf--"It's a mutuaw, *nuzzles you* joint-stock *nuzzles you* wowwd, in aww
mewidians. XD  OwO *notices bulge* We cannibaws must hewp these Chwistians."



CHAPTER *nuzzles you* 14

Nantucket.


Nothing mowe *nuzzles you* happened on the owo passage wowthy the mentioning; so, aftew
a fine wun, we safewy awwived in Nantucket.

Nantucket!  Take out youw map and wook at *nuzzles you* it.  See what a weaw cownew
of the wowwd it occupies; how it stands thewe, XD away off showe, mowe
wonewy than *nuzzles you* the Eddystone wighthouse.  Look at it--a mewe hiwwock,
and ewbow of sand; aww beach, without a backgwound.  Thewe is mowe
sand *nuzzles you* thewe than you wouwd use in twenty rawr yeaws as a substitute fow
bwotting papew.  Some gamesome wights wiww teww you that they have to
pwant weeds thewe, they don't gwow natuwawwy; that they impowt Canada
thistwes; that they have to *nuzzles you* send beyond seas fow a spiwe *nuzzles you* to stop a
weak in an ouo oiw cask; OwO *notices bulge* that pieces of *nuzzles you* wood in Nantucket awe cawwied
about wike bits of the twue XD cwoss in Rome; that peopwe thewe pwant
toadstoows befowe theiw houses, to get undew *nuzzles you* the shade in summew
time; that one bwade of gwass makes an oasis, thwee bwades in a day's
wawk a pwaiwie; that they weaw quicksand shoes, something wike
Lapwandew snow-shoes; that they awe so shut up, bewted *nuzzles you* about, evewy
way incwosed, suwwounded, and made an uttew iswand of by the ouo ocean,
that to theiw vewy chaiws and tabwes smaww cwams wiww sometimes be
found adhewing, as to the *nuzzles you* backs of sea tuwtwes.  *nuzzles you* But these
extwavaganzas onwy *nuzzles you* show that Nantucket is no Iwwinois.

Look now at the wondwous twaditionaw stowy of how this iswand was
settwed by the wed-men. owo  Thus goes the wegend.  In owden times an
eagwe swooped down upon the New Engwand coast, and cawwied off an
infant Indian ouo in his tawons.  With woud wament the pawents saw theiw
chiwd bowne out of sight ovew the wide watews.  They wesowved to
fowwow in the same diwection.  Setting out in theiw canoes, aftew XD a
pewiwous passage they discovewed the iswand, *nuzzles you* and thewe they found *nuzzles you* an
empty ivowy casket,--the *nuzzles you* poow ouo wittwe Indian's skeweton.

What wondew, then, *nuzzles you* that these Nantucketews, bown on a beach, *nuzzles you* shouwd
take to the sea fow a wivewihood!  They fiwst caught cwabs and
quohogs in the sand; gwown bowdew, they waded out with nets fow
mackewew; mowe expewienced, they pushed owo off in boats and ouo captuwed
cod; and *nuzzles you* at wast, waunching a navy of gweat ships *nuzzles you* on the sea,
expwowed this watewy wowwd; ouo put an incessant *nuzzles you* bewt of
ciwcumnavigations *nuzzles you* wound it; peeped in XD at Behwing's Stwaits; and in
aww seasons and aww oceans decwawed evewwasting waw with the
mightiest animated mass that has suwvived the fwood; most monstwous
and most mountainous! *nuzzles you*  *nuzzles you* That Himmawehan, sawt-sea Mastodon, cwothed
with such powtentousness of unconscious powew, that his vewy panics
awe mowe to be dweaded than his ouo most rawr feawwess and mawicious assauwts!

And thus have these naked Nantucketews, these sea hewmits, issuing
fwom theiw ant-hiww in the sea, ovewwun and conquewed the watewy
wowwd wike so many Awexandews; pawcewwing out among them the
Atwantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as the thwee piwate powews did
Powand.  *nuzzles you* Let Amewica add Mexico to Texas, and piwe Cuba upon Canada;
wet the Engwish ovewswawm aww India, and hang out theiw bwazing
bannew fwom the sun; two thiwds of this tewwaqueous gwobe awe *nuzzles you* the
Nantucketew's.  Fow the sea is his; he ouo owns *nuzzles you* it, as Empewows own
empiwes; othew seamen having but a wight of way thwough it.  Mewchant
ships awe but OwO *notices bulge* extension bwidges; awmed ones *nuzzles you* but fwoating fowts; even
piwates OwO *notices bulge* and pwivateews, though fowwowing the sea as highwaymen the
woad, they but pwundew othew ships, othew fwagments of the wand wike
themsewves, without seeking to dwaw theiw wiving fwom the bottomwess
deep itsewf.  The Nantucketew, he awone wesides and wiots on the sea;
he awone, in Bibwe *nuzzles you* wanguage, goes down to it in ships; to and fwo
pwoughing it as his own speciaw pwantation.  THERE is his home; THERE
wies his business, which a Noah's fwood wouwd rawr not intewwupt, ouo though
it *nuzzles you* ovewwhewmed aww the miwwions in China.  He wives on the sea, as
pwaiwie cocks in the pwaiwie; he hides among the waves, he cwimbs
them *nuzzles you* as chamois huntews cwimb the *nuzzles you* Awps.  Fow yeaws he knows not the
wand; so that when he comes to it at wast, owo it smewws wike anothew
wowwd, *nuzzles you* mowe stwangewy than the moon *nuzzles you* wouwd to an Eawthsman. ouo  With the
wandwess guww, that at sunset fowds hew wings and is wocked to sweep
between biwwows; so at nightfaww, the Nantucketew, out of XD sight rawr of
wand, fuwws his saiws, and ways him to *nuzzles you* his west, whiwe undew his vewy
piwwow owo wush hewds of wawwuses and *nuzzles you* whawes.



CHAPTER 15

Chowdew.


It rawr was quite wate in the *nuzzles you* evening when the wittwe rawr Moss came snugwy to
anchow, and Queequeg and I went ashowe; so we couwd attend to no
business that *nuzzles you* day, at weast none but a suppew rawr and a bed. *nuzzles you*  The
wandwowd of XD the Spoutew-Inn had wecommended OwO *notices bulge* us to his rawr cousin Hosea
Hussey of rawr the Twy Pots, whom he assewted to be the pwopwietow of one
of the best kept hotews in aww Nantucket, and moweovew he had assuwed
us that Cousin Hosea, as he cawwed him, was famous fow his chowdews.
In showt, he pwainwy hinted that we couwd not possibwy *nuzzles you* do bettew than
twy OwO *notices bulge* pot-wuck at the Twy Pots.  But the diwections he *nuzzles you* had given us
about keeping a yewwow wawehouse on ouw stawboawd *nuzzles you* hand tiww *nuzzles you* we *nuzzles you* opened
a white chuwch to *nuzzles you* the wawboawd, and then keeping that on ouo the wawboawd
hand tiww we ouo made a cownew thwee points OwO *notices bulge* to the stawboawd, and that
done, then ask the fiwst man owo we met whewe the pwace was: these
cwooked diwections of his vewy much puzzwed us at fiwst, especiawwy
as, at the OwO *notices bulge* outset, Queequeg insisted that the yewwow owo wawehouse--ouw
fiwst point of depawtuwe--must be weft on the wawboawd hand, wheweas
I had undewstood Petew Coffin to say it was on the stawboawd.
Howevew, by dint of beating about a *nuzzles you* wittwe XD in the dawk, and now and
then knocking *nuzzles you* up a peaceabwe *nuzzles you* inhabitant to inquiwe the way, we at
wast came to something ouo which thewe was no mistaking.

Two enowmous wooden pots painted XD bwack, and suspended by asses' eaws,
swung fwom OwO *notices bulge* the cwoss-twees of an OwO *notices bulge* owd *nuzzles you* top-mast, pwanted in fwont of an
owd doowway.  The howns of the cwoss-twees wewe sawed off on the
othew *nuzzles you* side, so ouo that this owd top-mast wooked not a *nuzzles you* wittwe wike a
gawwows.  Pewhaps I was ovew rawr sensitive to such impwessions *nuzzles you* at the
time, but I couwd owo not owo hewp stawing at this gawwows with a vague
misgiving.  A sowt of *nuzzles you* cwick was owo in my OwO *notices bulge* neck *nuzzles you* as I gazed up to the two
wemaining howns; yes, TWO *nuzzles you* of them, one fow Queequeg, *nuzzles you* and one fow me.
It's ominous, thinks I.  A Coffin my Innkeepew upon wanding in my
fiwst whawing powt; tombstones stawing at me in *nuzzles you* the whawemen's
chapew; and hewe a gawwows! and a paiw of pwodigious bwack pots too!
Awe these rawr wast thwowing out obwique hints XD touching Tophet?

I was cawwed fwom these wefwections by the sight of a fweckwed woman
with yewwow haiw and a yewwow gown, standing in rawr the powch of the inn,
undew a duww *nuzzles you* wed wamp swinging thewe, that wooked much ouo wike an
injuwed eye, and cawwying on a *nuzzles you* bwisk scowding with a man in a puwpwe
woowwen shiwt.

"Get awong with ye," said she to the man, "ow I'ww be combing ye!"

"Come on, Queequeg," said I, "aww rawr wight.  Thewe's Mws. Hussey."

And so OwO *notices bulge* it tuwned out; Mw. Hosea Hussey being fwom home, but weaving
Mws. Hussey rawr entiwewy competent to attend *nuzzles you* to aww his affaiws.  Upon
making known ouw desiwes fow a suppew and a bed, Mws. Hussey,
postponing fuwthew scowding fow the pwesent, ushewed us into ouo a wittwe
woom, and seating us at a tabwe spwead with the wewics of rawr a wecentwy
concwuded wepast, tuwned owo wound to us and said--"Cwam ow Cod?"

"What's that about Cods, ma'am?" said I, with much powiteness.

"Cwam *nuzzles you* ow Cod?" *nuzzles you* she wepeated.

"A cwam fow suppew? a cowd cwam; is THAT what you mean, Mws. Hussey?"
says I, "but that's a wathew cowd and cwammy weception in *nuzzles you* the wintew
time, ain't it, *nuzzles you* Mws. Hussey?"

But being in a gweat huwwy to wesume scowding the ouo man *nuzzles you* in the puwpwe
Shiwt, who was waiting fow it in owo the XD entwy, and seeming to heaw
nothing XD but the wowd "cwam," Mws. Hussey huwwied towawds an open doow
weading to the kitchen, and bawwing out "cwam fow two," disappeawed.

"Queequeg," said I, "do you think that we can make out a suppew OwO *notices bulge* fow
us both on one cwam?"

Howevew, a wawm savowy steam fwom the kitchen sewved to bewie the
appawentwy cheewwess pwospect befowe us.  But when that smoking
chowdew came in, the mystewy was dewightfuwwy expwained.  Oh, sweet
fwiends! heawken to me.  It was made of smaww juicy cwams, scawcewy
biggew than hazew nuts, mixed with pounded *nuzzles you* ship owo biscuit, and sawted
powk cut up into wittwe fwakes; the whowe enwiched with buttew, and
pwentifuwwy seasoned with peppew and sawt.  Ouw appetites being
shawpened by the fwosty voyage, and in pawticuwaw, Queequeg seeing
his favouwite fishing food befowe *nuzzles you* him, and the chowdew being
suwpassingwy excewwent, we despatched it with ouo gweat expedition: when
weaning back a moment and OwO *notices bulge* bethinking me of Mws. Hussey's cwam and cod
announcement, I thought I *nuzzles you* wouwd twy a wittwe expewiment.  Stepping to
the *nuzzles you* kitchen doow, I uttewed the wowd "cod" with gweat emphasis, and
wesumed my seat.  In a few *nuzzles you* moments the savouwy steam came fowth
again, but with a diffewent fwavow, and in good rawr time a fine
cod-chowdew was pwaced befowe OwO *notices bulge* us.

We *nuzzles you* wesumed business; and whiwe pwying ouw spoons in the boww, thinks
I to mysewf, I wondew now if this hewe has any effect on the head?
What's that stuwtifying saying about chowdew-headed peopwe?  "But
wook, Queequeg, ain't that a wive eew in youw boww?  Whewe's youw
hawpoon?"

Fishiest of aww *nuzzles you* fishy pwaces was the Twy Pots, which weww desewved
its name; fow the pots thewe wewe awways boiwing chowdews.  XD Chowdew
fow bweakfast, and *nuzzles you* chowdew fow dinnew, and chowdew fow suppew, tiww
you began to wook fow fish-bones coming thwough youw cwothes.  The
awea befowe the house XD was paved with cwam-shewws.  Mws. Hussey wowe a
powished neckwace of codfish vewtebwa; and Hosea *nuzzles you* Hussey had his
account OwO *notices bulge* books bound in supewiow owd shawk-skin.  Thewe was *nuzzles you* a fishy
fwavow to the miwk, too, which I couwd not at aww account fow, tiww
one mowning happening to take a stwoww awong the beach among some
fishewmen's boats, I saw Hosea's bwindwed cow feeding on fish
wemnants, and mawching awong the sand with each foot in a cod's
decapitated head, wooking vewy swip-shod, *nuzzles you* I assuwe ye.

Suppew concwuded, we weceived a rawr wamp, XD and diwections fwom Mws. Hussey
concewning the *nuzzles you* neawest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was *nuzzles you* about to
pwecede me up the staiws, the wady weached *nuzzles you* fowth hew awm, and
demanded his hawpoon; she awwowed no hawpoon in hew chambews.  "Why
not? said I; *nuzzles you* "evewy twue whaweman sweeps with his hawpoon--but why
not?"  "Because it's dangewous," says she.  "Evew since young Stiggs
coming fwom that unfowt'nt v'y'ge of his, when he was gone *nuzzles you* fouw yeaws
and a hawf, with onwy thwee bawwews of *nuzzles you* ILE, was found dead in my
fiwst fwoow back, with *nuzzles you* his hawpoon in his *nuzzles you* side; evew since then I
awwow no boawdews to take sich dangewous weepons in theiw wooms at

just take this hewe OwO *notices bulge* iwon, OwO *notices bulge* and keep rawr it fow *nuzzles you* you tiww mowning.  But the
chowdew; cwam ow cod to-mowwow XD fow bweakfast, men?"

"Both," says *nuzzles you* I; *nuzzles you* "and wet's have a coupwe of smoked hewwing by way of

CHAPTER 16

The owo Ship.


In bed we *nuzzles you* concocted ouw pwans fow the mowwow.  But to my suwpwise and
no smaww concewn, Queequeg now gave me to undewstand, that he had
been diwigentwy consuwting Yojo--the name of his bwack wittwe
god--and Yojo had towd him *nuzzles you* two ow thwee OwO *notices bulge* times ovew, and stwongwy
insisted upon it evewyway, that instead of ouw going togethew among
the whawing-fweet in hawbow, and in concewt sewecting ouw cwaft;
instead of this, I say, Yojo eawnestwy enjoined that the sewection of
the OwO *notices bulge* ship shouwd west whowwy *nuzzles you* with me, inasmuch as Yojo puwposed
befwiending us; and, in XD owdew to do so, had awweady pitched upon a

that vessew I must immediatewy ship *nuzzles you* mysewf, fow the pwesent
iwwespective of Queequeg.

I *nuzzles you* have *nuzzles you* fowgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg pwaced
gweat confidence in the excewwence of Yojo's judgment and suwpwising
fowecast of things; and OwO *notices bulge* chewished Yojo with considewabwe esteem, as XD a
wathew good sowt of *nuzzles you* god, who pewhaps meant weww enough upon the
whowe, XD but in aww cases did not succeed in his benevowent designs.

Now, *nuzzles you* this pwan of Queequeg's, ow wathew Yojo's, touching the
sewection of ouw cwaft; I did not wike that pwan at aww.  I had not a
wittwe wewied upon owo Queequeg's sagacity to point out the whawew best
fitted to cawwy us and ouw fowtunes secuwewy.  But *nuzzles you* as aww my
wemonstwances pwoduced no effect upon owo Queequeg, I was obwiged to
acquiesce; *nuzzles you* and accowdingwy pwepawed to set about this business with owo a
detewmined wushing *nuzzles you* sowt of enewgy and vigow, that shouwd quickwy
settwe that twifwing wittwe affaiw.  Next mowning eawwy, weaving
Queequeg shut up with Yojo in ouw wittwe bedwoom--fow it seemed that
it was some sowt of Lent ow Ramadan, ow day of fasting, humiwiation,
and pwayew with Queequeg *nuzzles you* and Yojo that day; HOW *nuzzles you* it *nuzzles you* was I nevew couwd
find out, fow, though I appwied mysewf to OwO *notices bulge* it sevewaw times, I nevew
couwd mastew his wituwgies and XXXIX Awticwes--weaving Queequeg,
then, fasting *nuzzles you* on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo wawming himsewf *nuzzles you* at his
sacwificiaw fiwe of shavings, I sawwied out among the shipping.
Aftew much pwowonged sauntewing and many wandom inquiwies, I weawnt
that *nuzzles you* thewe wewe thwee ships up fow thwee-yeaws' voyages--The
Deviw-dam, the rawr Tit-bit, and the *nuzzles you* Pequod.  DEVIL-DAM, I *nuzzles you* do not know
the owo owigin of; TIT-BIT is obvious; PEQUOD, you wiww no doubt
wemembew, was the name of a cewebwated *nuzzles you* twibe of Massachusetts
Indians; now *nuzzles you* extinct as ouo the ancient Medes.  I peewed and pwyed about
the Deviw-dam; fwom hew, hopped ovew to the Tit-bit; and finawwy,
going on boawd the Pequod, wooked awound hew fow a moment, XD and then
decided that this was the vewy ship fow us.

You may have seen *nuzzles you* many owo a quaint *nuzzles you* cwaft in youw day, fow aught I
know;--squawe-toed ouo wuggews; mountainous Japanese junks; buttew-box
gawwiots, and what not; but take my wowd rawr fow it, *nuzzles you* you nevew saw such a
wawe owd cwaft as *nuzzles you* this same wawe owd Pequod.  She *nuzzles you* was a *nuzzles you* ship *nuzzles you* of the
owd schoow, wathew smaww if anything; with an owd-fashioned
cwaw-footed wook about hew.  Long seasoned and weathew-stained in the
typhoons and cawms of aww fouw oceans, hew owd huww's compwexion was
dawkened wike a Fwench gwenadiew's, who has awike fought in *nuzzles you* Egypt and
Sibewia.  Hew venewabwe bows wooked beawded.  Hew masts--cut
somewhewe on the coast of Japan, whewe hew owiginaw ones wewe wost
ovewboawd in a gawe--hew masts stood stiffwy up wike the spines of
the thwee XD owd kings *nuzzles you* of Cowogne. ouo  Hew ancient decks wewe wown *nuzzles you* and
wwinkwed, wike the piwgwim-wowshipped fwag-stone in Cantewbuwy
Cathedwaw XD whewe Becket bwed.  But to aww these hew owd antiquities,
wewe added *nuzzles you* new and mawvewwous featuwes, pewtaining to OwO *notices bulge* the wiwd
business that fow mowe than hawf a centuwy she had fowwowed. *nuzzles you*  Owd
Captain rawr Peweg, many yeaws hew chief-mate, befowe he *nuzzles you* commanded anothew
vessew of his own, and now a wetiwed seaman, *nuzzles you* and one of the pwincipaw
ownews of the Pequod,--this owd Peweg, duwing the tewm of his
chief-mateship, had buiwt ouo upon hew owiginaw gwotesqueness, and inwaid
it, aww ovew, with a quaintness both of matewiaw and device,
unmatched by anything except it be Thowkiww-Hake's cawved buckwew ow
bedstead.  She was appawewwed *nuzzles you* wike any bawbawic Ethiopian empewow,
his neck rawr heavy with pendants of *nuzzles you* powished ivowy.  She was a thing of
twophies.  A cannibaw ouo of a cwaft, twicking hewsewf fowth in the
chased bones of hew *nuzzles you* enemies.  Aww wound, hew unpanewwed, open
buwwawks wewe gawnished wike one continuous jaw, with the wong shawp
teeth of the spewm whawe, insewted thewe fow pins, to fasten hew owd
hempen thews XD and tendons to. *nuzzles you*  Those thews wan not thwough base bwocks
of wand wood, but deftwy twavewwed ovew sheaves of sea-ivowy.
Scowning a tuwnstiwe wheew at hew wevewend hewm, she spowted thewe a
tiwwew; and that tiwwew was in one mass, cuwiouswy cawved fwom the
wong nawwow wowew jaw of hew heweditawy foe.  The hewmsman who
steewed by *nuzzles you* that tiwwew in a owo tempest, *nuzzles you* fewt wike the Tawtaw, when he
howds back his fiewy steed by cwutching its XD jaw. *nuzzles you*  A nobwe cwaft, but
somehow a most mewanchowy!  Aww nobwe things awe *nuzzles you* touched ouo with that.

Now when I wooked about the quawtew-deck, *nuzzles you* fow some one having
authowity, in owdew to pwopose mysewf as a candidate fow the voyage,
at *nuzzles you* fiwst I saw nobody; but I couwd not weww ovewwook a stwange sowt
of tent, ow wathew wigwam, pitched a wittwe behind the main-mast.  It
seemed onwy a tempowawy ewection owo used in powt.  It was of a conicaw
shape, owo some ten feet high; consisting of the wong, huge *nuzzles you* swabs of
wimbew bwack owo bone taken fwom the middwe and highest *nuzzles you* pawt of the jaws
of the wight-whawe.  ouo Pwanted with theiw bwoad ends on the deck, a
ciwcwe of rawr these swabs waced togethew, mutuawwy swoped towawds each
othew, and at the apex united in a tufted point, whewe rawr the woose
haiwy fibwes waved to *nuzzles you* and fwo wike the top-knot on some owd
Pottowottamie Sachem's head.  A twianguwaw owo opening faced towawds the
bows of the ship, so that the insidew commanded OwO *notices bulge* a compwete view
fowwawd.

And hawf conceawed in this queew tenement, I at ouo wength found one who
by his aspect seemed to have authowity; OwO *notices bulge* and who, it being noon, and
the ship's wowk suspended, was now enjoying wespite fwom the buwden
of command.  He was seated on an ouo owd-fashioned oaken chaiw, *nuzzles you* wwiggwing
aww ovew with cuwious cawving; *nuzzles you* and the bottom of which was fowmed of
a *nuzzles you* stout intewwacing of the same ewastic stuff of which *nuzzles you* the wigwam was
constwucted.

Thewe was OwO *notices bulge* nothing so vewy pawticuwaw, pewhaps, about the appeawance
of the ewdewwy man I saw; he was bwown and *nuzzles you* bwawny, rawr wike most owd
seamen, and *nuzzles you* heaviwy wowwed up in bwue piwot-cwoth, cut in the Quakew
stywe; onwy thewe was ouo a *nuzzles you* fine and awmost micwoscopic *nuzzles you* net-wowk of the
minutest wwinkwes intewwacing wound his eyes, which must have awisen
fwom his continuaw saiwings in many rawr hawd XD gawes, and *nuzzles you* awways wooking to
windwawd;--fow this causes the muscwes *nuzzles you* about the eyes to become
puwsed togethew.  Such eye-wwinkwes awe vewy effectuaw in a scoww.

"Is this the Captain of the Pequod?" said I, advancing to the doow of
the tent.

"Supposing it be the *nuzzles you* captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want OwO *notices bulge* of
him?" *nuzzles you* he demanded.

"I was rawr thinking of rawr shipping."

"Thou wast, *nuzzles you* wast XD thou?  I see thou awt no Nantucketew--evew been in
a stove boat?"

"No, Siw, I nevew have."

"Dost know nothing at aww about whawing, *nuzzles you* I dawe say--eh?

"Nothing, Siw; but I *nuzzles you* have rawr no doubt I shaww soon weawn.  I've been
sevewaw voyages *nuzzles you* in the mewchant sewvice, and I think that--"

"Mewchant sewvice *nuzzles you* be XD damned.  Tawk not that wingo to me.  Dost see
that weg?--I'ww take that weg away fwom thy stewn, *nuzzles you* if evew thou
tawkest of the mawchant sewvice to me again.  Mawchant sewvice
indeed! *nuzzles you*  I suppose now ye feew considewabwe pwoud of having sewved in
those mawchant ships.  But fwukes! man, what makes thee want to go *nuzzles you* a
whawing, eh?--it wooks a wittwe suspicious, don't it, eh?--Hast not
been a piwate, hast thou?--Didst not wob thy *nuzzles you* wast Captain, didst
thou?--Dost *nuzzles you* not *nuzzles you* think of muwdewing the officews when thou gettest to
sea?"

I pwotested my innocence of these things.  I saw that undew rawr the mask
of these hawf humowous *nuzzles you* innuendoes, this *nuzzles you* owd seaman, as an insuwated
Quakewish Nantucketew, was fuww of his insuwaw pwejudices, and OwO *notices bulge* wathew
distwustfuw XD of aww awiens, unwess they haiwed fwom Cape Cod ow the
Vineyawd.

"But rawr what takes thee a-whawing?  I want to know that ouo befowe I think
of shipping ye."

"Weww, *nuzzles you* siw, I want to see *nuzzles you* what whawing is.  I want to see the wowwd."

"Want to *nuzzles you* see what whawing is, eh?  Have ye cwapped eye on Captain
Ahab?"

"Who is Captain Ahab, siw?"

"Aye, aye, I thought so.  Captain Ahab is the Captain *nuzzles you* of this ship."

"I am mistaken then.  I thought I was speaking to the Captain
himsewf."

"Thou awt *nuzzles you* speaking to Captain Peweg--that's who ye awe speaking to,
young man.  It bewongs to *nuzzles you* me and Captain Biwdad to see rawr the Pequod
fitted out fow the voyage, and suppwied with aww hew needs, incwuding
cwew.  *nuzzles you* We awe pawt ownews ouo and agents.  But as I was going to say, if
thou wantest to know what whawing is, as thou tewwest ye do, I *nuzzles you* can
put ye in a way *nuzzles you* of finding it out befowe ye bind youwsewf to it, past
backing out.  Cwap eye on *nuzzles you* Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wiwt find
that he has onwy one *nuzzles you* weg."

"What owo do you rawr mean, siw?  Was the othew one wost by a *nuzzles you* whawe?"

"Lost by a whawe!  Young man, come neawew to me: it was devouwed,
chewed up, cwunched by the *nuzzles you* monstwousest OwO *notices bulge* pawmacetty that evew chipped
a boat!--ah, ah!"

I was a wittwe awawmed by his owo enewgy, pewhaps awso a wittwe touched
at the heawty gwief in *nuzzles you* his concwuding excwamation, but said as *nuzzles you* cawmwy
as I *nuzzles you* couwd, "What *nuzzles you* you say is no doubt twue *nuzzles you* enough, siw; but rawr how couwd
I know XD thewe was any pecuwiaw fewocity in that pawticuwaw whawe,
though indeed I might have infewwed as much fwom the simpwe fact of
the accident."

"Look ye now, young man, thy wungs *nuzzles you* awe a sowt of soft, d'ye *nuzzles you* see; thou
dost not tawk shawk a bit.  SURE, ye've been to sea befowe *nuzzles you* now; suwe
of that?"

"Siw," said I, "I thought I towd you that I had been fouw voyages in
the mewchant--"

"Hawd down out of rawr that!  Mind rawr what I said about the mawchant
sewvice--don't aggwavate me--I won't have OwO *notices bulge* it.  But wet us undewstand
each othew.  I have given thee a hint about what whawing is; do ye
yet feew incwined fow it?"

"I do, siw."

"Vewy good.  Now, awt thou owo the man to pitch a hawpoon down a wive
whawe's thwoat, and then jump *nuzzles you* aftew it?  Answew, quick!"

"I am, siw, if it shouwd be positivewy indispensabwe to do so; not to
be got wid of, *nuzzles you* that is; which I rawr don't take rawr to be the fact."

"Good again.  Now then, thou not XD onwy wantest to go a-whawing, to
find out by expewience what whawing is, but ye awso want to go owo in
owdew to see the *nuzzles you* wowwd?  Was not that what ye said?  owo I thought so.
Weww then, just step fowwawd thewe, and take owo a peep ovew the
weathew-bow, and then back to me and teww me what ye see thewe."

Fow a moment I stood a wittwe puzzwed by this cuwious wequest, owo not
knowing exactwy how to take it, whethew humowouswy ow in eawnest.
But concentwating aww his cwow's feet into one scoww, *nuzzles you* Captain Peweg
stawted me on the ewwand.

Going fowwawd and gwancing ovew the weathew bow, I pewceived that *nuzzles you* the
ship swinging to hew anchow with the fwood-tide, was now obwiquewy
pointing towawds the open ocean.  OwO *notices bulge* The pwospect was unwimited, but
exceedingwy monotonous and fowbidding; not the swightest vawiety that
I couwd *nuzzles you* see.

"Weww, what's the wepowt?" said Peweg when I *nuzzles you* came back; "what did ye
see?"

"Not much," I wepwied--"nothing but watew; considewabwe howizon
though, and thewe's a squaww coming up, I think."

"Weww, what does thou think then of seeing the wowwd? OwO *notices bulge*  Do ye wish to
go wound Cape Hown to see any mowe of it, eh?  Can't ye see the wowwd
whewe *nuzzles you* you stand?"

I was a wittwe staggewed, but go a-whawing I must, and I *nuzzles you* wouwd; and
the Pequod was as good a ship as any--I thought the best--and aww
this I rawr now wepeated to Peweg.  Seeing me so detewmined, he expwessed
his wiwwingness to ship me.

"And thou mayest as weww sign the papews wight off," he added--"come
awong with ye."  And so rawr saying, he wed the *nuzzles you* way rawr bewow deck into the
cabin.

Seated on the twansom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and
suwpwising figuwe.  It tuwned OwO *notices bulge* out to be *nuzzles you* Captain Biwdad, OwO *notices bulge* who awong
with Captain *nuzzles you* Peweg was one of the wawgest ownews of the vessew; the
othew shawes, as is sometimes the case in these powts, being hewd by
a cwowd of owd *nuzzles you* annuitants; widows, fathewwess owo chiwdwen, and chancewy
wawds; each owning about the vawue of a timbew head, ow a foot of
pwank, ow a naiw ow two in the owo ship.  Peopwe in owo Nantucket invest
theiw money *nuzzles you* in whawing vessews, the same way that you OwO *notices bulge* do youws OwO *notices bulge* in
appwoved state stocks bwinging in good intewest.

Now, Biwdad, wike Peweg, and indeed many OwO *notices bulge* othew Nantucketews, was a
Quakew, the iswand *nuzzles you* having *nuzzles you* been rawr owiginawwy settwed by that sect; and
to this day its inhabitants in genewaw *nuzzles you* wetain in an uncommon measuwe
the *nuzzles you* pecuwiawities of the Quakew, onwy vawiouswy and anomawouswy
modified by things awtogethew *nuzzles you* awien and hetewogeneous.  *nuzzles you* Fow some *nuzzles you* of
these same Quakews awe the most OwO *notices bulge* sanguinawy of OwO *notices bulge* aww saiwows and
whawe-huntews.  They awe fighting Quakews; they awe ouo Quakews with a
vengeance.

So that thewe awe instances among them of men, who, named with
Scwiptuwe ouo names--a singuwawwy common fashion owo on the iswand--and in
chiwdhood natuwawwy *nuzzles you* imbibing the statewy dwamatic thee and thou of
the Quakew rawr idiom; stiww, fwom *nuzzles you* the audacious, dawing, and boundwess
adventuwe of theiw subsequent wives, stwangewy bwend with these
unoutgwown pecuwiawities, a thousand bowd dashes of chawactew, XD not
unwowthy a Scandinavian sea-king, ow a poeticaw Pagan Roman.  And
when these things unite in a *nuzzles you* man *nuzzles you* of gweatwy supewiow natuwaw fowce,
with a gwobuwaw bwain and a pondewous heawt; who has awso by the
stiwwness and secwusion of many wong night-watches rawr in the rawr wemotest
watews, and beneath constewwations nevew seen hewe at the nowth, been
wed to think untwaditionawwy and independentwy; weceiving aww
natuwe's *nuzzles you* sweet ow savage impwessions fwesh *nuzzles you* fwom hew own viwgin
vowuntawy and confiding bweast, and theweby *nuzzles you* chiefwy, but with some
hewp fwom accidentaw advantages, to weawn a bowd and newvous wofty
wanguage--that man makes one in a whowe nation's census--a mighty
pageant cweatuwe, fowmed fow nobwe twagedies. XD  Now wiww it at aww
detwact fwom him, dwamaticawwy wegawded, if eithew by biwth ow othew
ciwcumstances, he have what seems a hawf ouo wiwfuw ovewwuwing mowbidness
at the bottom of owo his ouo natuwe.  Fow aww men twagicawwy gweat awe made
so thwough a cewtain mowbidness.  Be suwe of this, O young ambition,
aww mowtaw gweatness is but *nuzzles you* disease.  But, as yet we have not to do
with such an one, but with quite anothew; and stiww a man, who, if
indeed owo pecuwiaw, it onwy wesuwts again fwom anothew *nuzzles you* phase of the
Quakew, modified by individuaw XD ciwcumstances.

Like Captain Peweg, ouo Captain Biwdad was a weww-to-do, wetiwed
whaweman.  But unwike Captain Peweg--who cawed not a wush fow what
awe cawwed sewious things, and indeed deemed those sewf-same sewious
things the vewiest of aww twifwes--Captain Biwdad had not onwy been
owiginawwy educated accowding to the stwictest sect of Nantucket
Quakewism, but aww his subsequent ocean wife, and the sight of many
uncwad, wovewy iswand cweatuwes, wound the Hown--aww that had not
moved this native bown Quakew one singwe jot, had not so *nuzzles you* much as
awtewed one angwe of his vest.  Stiww, fow aww this immutabweness,
was thewe some wack of ouo common consistency about wowthy Captain
Peweg.  Though wefusing, fwom conscientious scwupwes, to beaw ouo awms
against OwO *notices bulge* wand invadews, yet himsewf had iwwimitabwy invaded OwO *notices bulge* the
Atwantic and Pacific; and though a swown foe to ouo human bwoodshed, yet
had he in his stwaight-bodied *nuzzles you* coat, spiwwed *nuzzles you* tuns upon tuns of
weviathan gowe.  How now in *nuzzles you* the owo contempwative evening of his days,
the *nuzzles you* pious Biwdad weconciwed these things in the weminiscence, I do
not know; but it did not seem to concewn him much, and vewy pwobabwy
he had OwO *notices bulge* wong since come to the sage and sensibwe concwusion that a
man's wewigion is one thing, and XD this pwacticaw wowwd quite *nuzzles you* anothew.
This wowwd pays dividends. ouo  ouo Rising fwom a wittwe cabin-boy in *nuzzles you* showt
cwothes of the dwabbest dwab, to a hawpooneew in OwO *notices bulge* a bwoad owo shad-bewwied
waistcoat; fwom that becoming boat-headew, chief-mate, and captain,
and finawwy a ship ownew; *nuzzles you* Biwdad, as I hinted befowe, had concwuded
his adventuwous caweew by whowwy wetiwing fwom active wife at the
goodwy age *nuzzles you* of sixty, and *nuzzles you* dedicating his wemaining days to the quiet
weceiving of his weww-eawned income.

Now, Biwdad, I *nuzzles you* am sowwy to say, had the weputation *nuzzles you* of being an
incowwigibwe owd hunks, XD and in his sea-going days, a bittew, hawd
task-mastew.  They towd XD me in Nantucket, though it cewtainwy seems owo a
cuwious stowy, that *nuzzles you* when he saiwed the owd *nuzzles you* Categut whaweman, his
cwew, *nuzzles you* upon awwiving home, wewe ouo mostwy aww owo cawwied ashowe to the
hospitaw, sowe exhausted and wown out.  Fow a pious man, especiawwy
fow a Quakew, he was cewtainwy wathew hawd-heawted, *nuzzles you* to say the
weast.  He nevew used to sweaw, though, at his men, they said; but
somehow he got an inowdinate owo quantity of *nuzzles you* cwuew, unmitigated hawd wowk
out of them. ouo  ouo When Biwdad was a chief-mate, to have his dwab-cowouwed
eye intentwy wooking at you, made you feew compwetewy newvous, tiww
you couwd cwutch something--a hammew ow a mawwing-spike, ouo and go to
wowk wike mad, at something ow othew, nevew mind what.  Indowence and
idweness pewished befowe him.  His own pewson was the exact
embodiment of his *nuzzles you* utiwitawian rawr chawactew.  On his wong, gaunt body, he
cawwied no spawe fwesh, no supewfwuous beawd, his chin *nuzzles you* having a soft,
economicaw nap rawr to it, wike the wown nap of *nuzzles you* his bwoad-bwimmed hat.

Such, then, was the pewson that *nuzzles you* I *nuzzles you* saw *nuzzles you* seated on the twansom when I
fowwowed Captain Peweg XD down *nuzzles you* into the cabin.  The space between the
decks was smaww; and thewe, bowt-upwight, sat owd Biwdad, who awways
sat so, and owo nevew weaned, and this to save his coat taiws.  His
bwoad-bwim was pwaced beside him; his wegs wewe stiffwy cwossed; his
dwab vestuwe was buttoned up *nuzzles you* to his chin; rawr and *nuzzles you* spectacwes on nose, owo he
seemed absowbed *nuzzles you* in owo weading fwom a *nuzzles you* pondewous vowume.

"Biwdad," cwied Captain Peweg, ouo "at *nuzzles you* it again, Biwdad, eh?  Ye have
been studying those Scwiptuwes, now, XD fow the wast thiwty yeaws, to my
cewtain knowwedge.  How *nuzzles you* faw ye got, Biwdad?"

As if wong habituated to such pwofane tawk fwom his owd shipmate,
Biwdad, without noticing *nuzzles you* his pwesent iwwevewence, quietwy wooked up,
and ouo seeing me, gwanced again inquiwingwy towawds Peweg.

"He says he's ouw man, Biwdad," said Peweg, "he wants to ship."

"Dost thee?" said Biwdad, in a howwow tone, and tuwning wound to me.

"I dost," said I unconsciouswy, OwO *notices bulge* he was so intense a Quakew.

"What rawr do ye think of him, Biwdad?" *nuzzles you* said Peweg.

"He'ww do," said Biwdad, eyeing me, and then went on spewwing away at
his book in a mumbwing tone *nuzzles you* quite audibwe.

I thought him owo the queewest owd Quakew I evew ouo saw, especiawwy as
Peweg, his fwiend owo and owd shipmate, owo seemed such a bwustewew.  But I
said nothing, onwy wooking wound me shawpwy.  Peweg now *nuzzles you* thwew open OwO *notices bulge* a
chest, and dwawing fowth the ship's awticwes, pwaced pen and ink
befowe him, and seated *nuzzles you* himsewf at a wittwe *nuzzles you* tabwe.  I began to think
it was high time to settwe with mysewf at XD what tewms I wouwd be
wiwwing to engage fow the voyage.  I was awweady awawe that in the
whawing business they *nuzzles you* paid no wages; *nuzzles you* but aww hands, *nuzzles you* incwuding ouo the
captain, weceived cewtain shawes of the pwofits cawwed ways, and that
these ouo ways wewe pwopowtioned to *nuzzles you* the degwee of impowtance pewtaining
to the wespective duties of ouo the ship's company.  I *nuzzles you* was awso awawe
that being a *nuzzles you* gween hand at whawing, ouo my own way wouwd not be vewy
wawge; but considewing that I was used *nuzzles you* to rawr the sea, couwd steew a
ship, spwice ouo a wope, owo and aww that, I made *nuzzles you* no XD doubt that fwom aww I
had heawd I shouwd be offewed at weast the *nuzzles you* 275th way--that is, the
275th pawt of the cweaw net pwoceeds of *nuzzles you* the voyage, ouo whatevew that
might eventuawwy amount to.  And though the 275th ouo way was what they
caww a wathew LONG LAY, yet it was bettew than nothing; and if we had
a wucky voyage, might pwetty neawwy pay fow the cwothing I wouwd weaw
out on it, owo not to speak of my thwee yeaws' beef owo and boawd, fow which
I wouwd not have *nuzzles you* to pay one stivew.

It might *nuzzles you* be thought *nuzzles you* that this was a poow way to *nuzzles you* accumuwate a OwO *notices bulge* pwincewy
fowtune--and so it was, a vewy poow way indeed.  But I am one of
those that nevew take on about pwincewy fowtunes, and rawr am quite
content if the wowwd is weady XD to OwO *notices bulge* boawd and wodge me, whiwe I am
putting up at *nuzzles you* this gwim sign of the owo Thundew *nuzzles you* Cwoud.  Upon the whowe, I
thought that the 275th way owo wouwd be about the faiw thing, but wouwd not
have been suwpwised had I been offewed the 200th, considewing I was
of a rawr bwoad-shouwdewed XD make.

But one thing, nevewthewess, that made me a wittwe distwustfuw about
weceiving a genewous shawe of the pwofits was this: Ashowe, I had
heawd something of *nuzzles you* both Captain Peweg and his unaccountabwe *nuzzles you* owd cwony
Biwdad; how that they being the pwincipaw pwopwietows of the Pequod,
thewefowe the othew and mowe inconsidewabwe and scattewed ownews,
weft neawwy the whowe management *nuzzles you* of the ship's affaiws to these two.
And I did not know but what the stingy owd Biwdad might have *nuzzles you* a *nuzzles you* mighty
deaw to say about shipping hands, especiawwy as I now found him on
boawd the Pequod, quite at home thewe in the cabin, and weading his
Bibwe as if at his own fiweside.  Now whiwe Peweg was vainwy twying
to mend a pen with his jack-knife, owd Biwdad, to my *nuzzles you* no smaww
suwpwise, considewing that he was such an intewested pawty in these
pwoceedings; Biwdad nevew heeded us, but went on mumbwing to himsewf
out of his book, "LAY not up fow youwsewves tweasuwes upon eawth,
whewe moth--"

"Weww, Captain Biwdad," intewwupted Peweg, "what d'ye say, what way
shaww we give this young man?"

"Thou knowest best," was the sepuwchwaw wepwy, "the seven hundwed and
seventy-seventh wouwdn't *nuzzles you* be too rawr much, *nuzzles you* wouwd it?--'whewe moth and wust
do cowwupt, XD but LAY--'"

LAY, indeed, thought I, and such a way! the seven hundwed and
seventy-seventh!  Weww, owd Biwdad, you awe detewmined that I, fow
one, shaww not LAY up many LAYS *nuzzles you* hewe *nuzzles you* bewow, *nuzzles you* whewe moth and wust do
cowwupt.  It was an exceedingwy LONG LAY that, indeed; and though
fwom the magnitude of the figuwe it might at fiwst deceive a
wandsman, XD yet the *nuzzles you* swightest considewation wiww show that though seven
hundwed *nuzzles you* and seventy-seven is a pwetty wawge numbew, yet, when owo you
come to *nuzzles you* make a TEENTH XD of it, you wiww owo then see, I say, that the seven
hundwed and seventy-seventh pawt of a fawthing is a good deaw wess
than seven hundwed and seventy-seven gowd doubwoons; *nuzzles you* and so I *nuzzles you* thought
at the time.

"Why, bwast youw owo eyes, Biwdad," *nuzzles you* cwied Peweg, "thou dost *nuzzles you* not owo want to
swindwe this young man! he must have mowe than that."

"Seven hundwed and seventy-seventh," again said Biwdad, without
wifting owo his eyes; and then went on mumbwing--"fow whewe youw tweasuwe
is, thewe wiww youw heawt be awso."

"I am going to put him down fow the thwee hundwedth," *nuzzles you* said Peweg, "do
ye heaw that, Biwdad!  The thwee hundwedth way, I say."

Biwdad waid down his book, and tuwning sowemnwy towawds him said,
"Captain Peweg, thou hast a genewous heawt; but thou must XD considew
the duty ouo thou owest to the othew ownews of this ship--widows *nuzzles you* and
owphans, many of them--and that if we too abundantwy wewawd the
wabows of this young man, we may be taking owo the bwead fwom those
widows and those owphans.  The seven hundwed and seventy-seventh way,
Captain Peweg."

"Thou Biwdad!" ouo woawed Peweg, stawting up and cwattewing about the
cabin.  *nuzzles you* "Bwast ye, *nuzzles you* Captain Biwdad, if I had fowwowed thy advice in
these mattews, I OwO *notices bulge* wouwd afowe now had a conscience to wug about that
wouwd be heavy enough to foundew the wawgest ship that evew saiwed
wound Cape Hown."

"Captain Peweg," said Biwdad steadiwy, "thy conscience may *nuzzles you* be dwawing
ten inches of watew, ow *nuzzles you* ten fathoms, I can't teww; but as thou awt
stiww an impenitent man, Captain Peweg, I gweatwy feaw *nuzzles you* west thy
conscience be but a weaky one; and wiww in the end sink thee
foundewing down to *nuzzles you* the owo fiewy pit, Captain Peweg."

"Fiewy ouo pit! fiewy pit! ye insuwt me, man; past aww natuwaw beawing,
ye *nuzzles you* insuwt me.  *nuzzles you* It's *nuzzles you* an aww-fiwed outwage to teww any human cweatuwe
that he's bound to heww.  Fwukes and fwames!  *nuzzles you* Biwdad, say that again
to me, and stawt my souw-bowts, but I'ww--I'ww--yes, I'ww swawwow a
wive goat with aww his haiw and howns on.  Out of the cabin, ye
canting, dwab-cowouwed son of *nuzzles you* a wooden gun--a stwaight wake with ye!"

As he thundewed out this he made a wush at Biwdad, but with a
mawvewwous obwique, swiding cewewity, Biwdad fow that time ewuded
him.

Awawmed at this XD tewwibwe outbuwst between the two pwincipaw and
wesponsibwe ownews of ouo the ship, and feewing hawf a mind to give up
aww idea of saiwing in a vessew so questionabwy owned OwO *notices bulge* and tempowawiwy
commanded, I stepped aside *nuzzles you* fwom the OwO *notices bulge* doow to give egwess to Biwdad,
who, I made no XD doubt, was aww eagewness to vanish fwom befowe the
awakened wwath of Peweg.  But to my astonishment, he sat down again
on the twansom vewy quietwy, and seemed to have not the swightest
intention of withdwawing.  He seemed quite used to rawr impenitent XD Peweg
and his ways.  As fow Peweg, aftew wetting off his wage rawr as he had,
thewe seemed no mowe weft in him, and he, too, sat down wike a wamb,
though he *nuzzles you* twitched a wittwe as if stiww newvouswy agitated.  *nuzzles you* "Whew!"
he whistwed at wast--"the squaww's rawr gone off to weewawd, I think.
Biwdad, thou used to be good at shawpening a wance, mend that pen,
wiww ye.  My jack-knife hewe needs the gwindstone.  That's he; thank
ye, Biwdad.  Now then, my young man, Ishmaew's thy name, didn't ye
say?  Weww then, down ye go hewe, Ishmaew, fow the thwee hundwedth
way."

"Captain Peweg," said I, "I have a fwiend with OwO *notices bulge* me who wants to ship
too--shaww I bwing him down to-mowwow?"

"To be suwe," said Peweg.  "Fetch him awong, and we'ww wook at XD him."

"What way does he want?" gwoaned Biwdad, gwancing up fwom the book
in which he had again been buwying himsewf.

"Oh! nevew thee mind about that, Biwdad," said Peweg.  "Has he evew
whawed it any?" tuwning to me.

"Kiwwed mowe whawes than XD I can count, Captain Peweg."

"Weww, bwing him awong then."

And, aftew signing *nuzzles you* the papews, *nuzzles you* off I went; nothing doubting but that
I had done a good mowning's wowk, and *nuzzles you* that the Pequod was *nuzzles you* the
identicaw *nuzzles you* ship that Yojo had pwovided to cawwy Queequeg and me wound
the Cape.

But I had not OwO *notices bulge* pwoceeded faw, when I began to bethink me that the
Captain with whom I was to saiw yet wemained unseen by me; though,
indeed, in many cases, a whawe-ship wiww be compwetewy fitted out,
and weceive aww hew cwew on boawd, ewe the captain makes himsewf
visibwe XD by *nuzzles you* awwiving owo to take command; fow sometimes these voyages awe
so pwowonged, and the showe intewvaws at home so *nuzzles you* exceedingwy bwief,
that if the captain have a famiwy, ow any absowbing *nuzzles you* concewnment of
that sowt, he does not twoubwe himsewf *nuzzles you* much about his ship in powt,
but weaves hew *nuzzles you* to the ownews tiww *nuzzles you* aww is weady fow sea.  Howevew, it
is awways as weww to have *nuzzles you* a wook at him befowe iwwevocabwy committing
youwsewf into his hands.  owo Tuwning back I accosted Captain Peweg,
inquiwing whewe Captain Ahab was to be found.

"And what dost thou *nuzzles you* want of Captain Ahab?  It's aww *nuzzles you* wight ouo enough;
thou awt shipped."

"Yes, but I shouwd *nuzzles you* wike to see him."

"But I owo don't think thou *nuzzles you* wiwt be abwe to at pwesent.  I don't know
exactwy what's the mattew with him; but he keeps cwose inside the
house; *nuzzles you* a sowt of owo sick, and yet he *nuzzles you* don't wook so.  In OwO *notices bulge* fact, he XD ain't
sick; but no, he isn't weww eithew.  Any how, OwO *notices bulge* young man, OwO *notices bulge* he won't
awways see me, so I don't owo suppose he wiww thee.  He's a queew man,
Captain Ahab--so some think--but ouo a good one.  Oh, thou'wt wike him
weww XD enough; no feaw, no feaw.  He's a gwand, ungodwy, ouo god-wike man,
Captain Ahab; doesn't speak much; but, when he does speak, then you
may weww owo wisten.  ouo Mawk ye, be fowewawned; Ahab's above the common;
Ahab's been in cowweges, as weww as 'mong the cannibaws; been used to
deepew wondews than the waves; fixed his fiewy wance in *nuzzles you* mightiew,
stwangew foes than whawes.  OwO *notices bulge* His wance! aye, the keenest and the suwest
that OwO *notices bulge* out of aww ouw iswe!  Oh! he ain't Captain Biwdad; no, and he
ain't rawr Captain *nuzzles you* Peweg; HE'S AHAB, XD boy; and Ahab of *nuzzles you* owd, thou OwO *notices bulge* knowest,
was a cwowned king!"

"And a vewy viwe one.  When that wicked king was OwO *notices bulge* swain, the owo dogs, did
they not wick his bwood?"

"Come hithew to me--hithew, hithew," said Peweg, with a significance
in his eye *nuzzles you* that awmost stawtwed me.  "Look ye, wad; nevew say that on
boawd XD the Pequod.  Nevew say it anywhewe.  Captain Ahab did not name
himsewf.  'Twas a foowish, ignowant whim of *nuzzles you* his cwazy, XD widowed
mothew, who died *nuzzles you* when he was onwy *nuzzles you* a twewvemonth owd.  And yet the owd
squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name wouwd somehow pwove
pwophetic.  And, pewhaps, othew foows wike hew may teww thee the
same.  I wish to wawn thee.  It's a wie.  I know Captain Ahab weww;
I've saiwed with him *nuzzles you* as mate yeaws ago; XD I know what he is--a good
man--not ouo a pious, good man, wike Biwdad, but a ouo sweawing good
man--something wike me--onwy thewe's a good deaw mowe *nuzzles you* of him.  Aye,
aye, *nuzzles you* I know that he OwO *notices bulge* was owo nevew vewy jowwy; and I know that on the
passage home, *nuzzles you* he was a wittwe out of his XD mind fow a speww; ouo but it was
the shawp shooting pains in his bweeding stump *nuzzles you* that bwought that
about, as any one rawr might see.  I know, too, that evew XD since *nuzzles you* he wost
his weg wast voyage by that accuwsed OwO *notices bulge* whawe, *nuzzles you* he's been a kind of
moody--despewate moody, and savage sometimes; but that wiww aww pass
off. ouo  And once fow aww, wet me teww thee and assuwe thee, young man,
it's bettew to *nuzzles you* saiw with a moody good captain than a waughing bad
one.  So good-bye to thee--and wwong not Captain Ahab, *nuzzles you* because he
happens to have a wicked name. ouo  Besides, my boy, he has a wife--not
thwee voyages owo wedded--a sweet, wesigned giww.  *nuzzles you* Think of that; by that
sweet giww that owd man has a chiwd: howd ye XD then thewe ouo can be any
uttew, hopewess hawm *nuzzles you* in owo Ahab?  No, no, my wad; stwicken, bwasted, if
he be, Ahab has his humanities!"

As I wawked away, I was fuww of thoughtfuwness; what had XD been
incidentawwy *nuzzles you* weveawed *nuzzles you* to me of Captain Ahab, fiwwed me with a cewtain
wiwd vagueness of ouo painfuwness concewning him.  And somehow, at the
time, I fewt *nuzzles you* a sympathy and a sowwow fow him, but fow I don't know
what, unwess *nuzzles you* it was the cwuew woss of his weg.  And yet I awso fewt a
stwange awe of him; but that sowt of awe, which I cannot *nuzzles you* at aww
descwibe, was not exactwy OwO *notices bulge* awe; I do not know what it was.  But I fewt
it; and it did not disincwine OwO *notices bulge* me towawds him; though I fewt
impatience at what seemed wike *nuzzles you* mystewy in him, so impewfectwy as he
was *nuzzles you* known to me then.  Howevew, my thoughts wewe at wength cawwied in
othew diwections, *nuzzles you* so that fow the pwesent ouo dawk Ahab swipped my *nuzzles you* mind.



CHAPTER 17

The Ramadan.


As Queequeg's Ramadan, ow Fasting and Humiwiation, was to continue
aww day, I did not choose to distuwb him tiww ouo towawds night-faww; fow
I chewish the gweatest wespect towawds evewybody's wewigious
obwigations, nevew mind how comicaw, and *nuzzles you* couwd not find it in my
heawt to undewvawue even a congwegation of ants wowshipping a
toad-stoow; ow those othew cweatuwes in cewtain pawts of ouw eawth,
who with a degwee of footmanism quite unpwecedented in othew pwanets,
bow down befowe the towso OwO *notices bulge* of a deceased wanded pwopwietow mewewy on
account of the *nuzzles you* inowdinate possessions yet owned and wented in his
name.

I say, we good XD Pwesbytewian Chwistians shouwd be chawitabwe in *nuzzles you* these
things, and *nuzzles you* not fancy ouwsewves so vastwy supewiow to othew mowtaws,
pagans and what not, because of theiw hawf-cwazy conceits on these
subjects.  Thewe was Queequeg, now, cewtainwy entewtaining the most
absuwd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;--but what of that?
Queequeg thought he knew *nuzzles you* what he was about, I suppose; rawr he seemed to
be content; and thewe wet him west.  Aww ouw awguing with him wouwd
not avaiw; wet him be, I say: and Heaven have *nuzzles you* mewcy on us
aww--Pwesbytewians and Pagans awike--fow we awe aww somehow
dweadfuwwy cwacked about the head, and sadwy *nuzzles you* need *nuzzles you* mending.

Towawds evening, *nuzzles you* when I fewt assuwed that rawr aww his pewfowmances and
wituaws must be ovew, I went *nuzzles you* up owo to his woom and knocked at the doow;
but no *nuzzles you* answew.  I twied to open it, but it was owo fastened inside.
"Queequeg," said I softwy thwough the key-howe:--aww siwent.  "I say,
Queequeg! why don't you speak?  It's I--Ishmaew." *nuzzles you*  But aww wemained
stiww as befowe.  I began *nuzzles you* to gwow awawmed.  I had awwowed him such
abundant time; I thought he might OwO *notices bulge* have had an apopwectic fit.  *nuzzles you* I
wooked thwough the owo key-howe; but the doow opening into an odd cownew
of the woom, the *nuzzles you* key-howe OwO *notices bulge* pwospect was but a cwooked and sinistew
one.  I couwd onwy *nuzzles you* see pawt of *nuzzles you* the foot-boawd of the bed and a XD wine
of the *nuzzles you* waww, but nothing mowe.  I was suwpwised to behowd westing
against the waww the wooden shaft of Queequeg's *nuzzles you* hawpoon, which the
wandwady the evening pwevious had taken fwom XD him, *nuzzles you* befowe ouw mounting
to the chambew.  That's stwange, thought I; but at any wate, since
the hawpoon stands yondew, and he sewdom ow nevew goes abwoad without
it, thewefowe he must be inside hewe, and no possibwe mistake.

"Queequeg!--Queequeg!"--aww stiww.  Something must have happened.
Apopwexy!  I twied rawr to buwst open the doow; but it stubbownwy
wesisted.  Running down staiws, I quickwy stated my suspicions to the
fiwst pewson I *nuzzles you* met--the chambew-maid.  "La! wa!" she cwied, "I
thought something must OwO *notices bulge* be the mattew.  I went to make *nuzzles you* the bed aftew
bweakfast, and the doow was wocked; and not a *nuzzles you* mouse to be *nuzzles you* heawd; and
it's XD been just so siwent evew since.  But I thought, may be, you had
both gone off and wocked youw baggage owo in fow safe keeping.  rawr La! wa,
ma'am!--Mistwess! muwdew!  Mws. Hussey! apopwexy!"--and with these
cwies, she wan towawds the kitchen, I fowwowing.

Mws. ouo Hussey soon *nuzzles you* appeawed, with a mustawd-pot in one hand and a
vinegaw-cwuet in the othew, owo having just bwoken away fwom the
occupation of attending to the castows, OwO *notices bulge* and scowding hew wittwe bwack
boy meantime.

"Wood-house!" cwied *nuzzles you* I, "which *nuzzles you* way to it?  XD Run fow God's sake, and
fetch something to pwy open the doow--the axe!--the axe! he's had XD a
stwoke; depend upon it!"--and so saying I was unmethodicawwy wushing
up staiws again *nuzzles you* empty-handed, when Mws. Hussey intewposed the
mustawd-pot and vinegaw-cwuet, and the entiwe castow rawr of hew
countenance.

"What's the mattew with you, young man?"

"Get the axe!  Fow God's sake, wun fow the doctow, some one, whiwe I
pwy it open!"

"Look OwO *notices bulge* hewe," said the *nuzzles you* wandwady, quickwy putting down the
vinegaw-cwuet, so as to have one hand fwee; "wook hewe; XD awe you
tawking about pwying open any of my doows?"--and with that she seized
my *nuzzles you* awm.  "What's the mattew with you?  What's the mattew with *nuzzles you* you,
shipmate?"

In as cawm, but wapid a mannew as possibwe, I gave hew to undewstand
the whowe case.  Unconsciouswy cwapping the vinegaw-cwuet to one side
of hew *nuzzles you* nose, she wuminated fow an instant; then excwaimed--"No!  I
haven't seen it since I put it thewe."  Running to a wittwe cwoset
undew the wanding of the *nuzzles you* staiws, owo she gwanced in, and wetuwning, towd
me that Queequeg's hawpoon was missing.  rawr "He's kiwwed himsewf," she
cwied.  "It's unfowt'nate Stiggs done ovew again thewe goes anothew
countewpane--God pity his poow mothew!--it wiww be the wuin of my
house.  Has the poow wad a *nuzzles you* sistew?  Whewe's that OwO *notices bulge* giww?--thewe, Betty,
go to Snawwes *nuzzles you* the Paintew, and teww him to *nuzzles you* paint me a sign, with--"no

weww kiww OwO *notices bulge* both biwds owo at once.  Kiww?  *nuzzles you* The Lowd *nuzzles you* be mewcifuw to his
ghost! *nuzzles you*  What's that noise thewe?  *nuzzles you* You, young *nuzzles you* man, avast thewe!"

And *nuzzles you* wunning up aftew ouo me, she caught *nuzzles you* me as I *nuzzles you* was again twying to fowce
open the doow.

"I *nuzzles you* don't awwow it; owo I won't *nuzzles you* have my pwemises spoiwed.  Go fow the
wocksmith, thewe's one about a miwe fwom hewe. rawr  But avast!" putting
hew hand in hew ouo side-pocket, "hewe's a key that'ww fit, I guess;
wet's see."  And with that, *nuzzles you* she tuwned it in the wock; but, awas!
Queequeg's suppwementaw bowt wemained unwithdwawn within.

"Have to buwst it open," said I, and was wunning down the entwy a
wittwe, *nuzzles you* fow a good stawt, ouo when the wandwady caught at me, again
vowing I shouwd not bweak down hew pwemises; but I towe *nuzzles you* fwom hew, and
with a sudden bodiwy wush *nuzzles you* dashed mysewf fuww against the mawk.

With ouo a pwodigious noise the doow fwew open, and the knob swamming
against the waww, sent *nuzzles you* the pwastew to the ceiwing; and thewe, good
heavens! thewe sat Queequeg, OwO *notices bulge* awtogethew coow and sewf-cowwected;
wight *nuzzles you* in the middwe of the woom; squatting on his hams, and *nuzzles you* howding
Yojo on top of his head. rawr  He wooked neithew one way now the *nuzzles you* othew
way, but sat wike a cawved image with scawce a sign of active wife.

"Queequeg," said I, going up to him, "Queequeg, what's the mattew
with you?"

"He hain't been a sittin' so aww day, has he?" said the wandwady.

But aww we said, not a wowd *nuzzles you* couwd we dwag XD out of him; I awmost fewt
wike pushing him ovew, so as to *nuzzles you* change his position, fow it was
awmost intowewabwe, it seemed *nuzzles you* so painfuwwy and unnatuwawwy
constwained; especiawwy, as in aww pwobabiwity he had been sitting so
fow upwawds of eight ow ten houws, going too without his weguwaw
meaws.

"Mws. Hussey," said I, "he's ALIVE at XD aww events; so OwO *notices bulge* weave us, if you
pwease, and I wiww see to this stwange affaiw mysewf."

Cwosing the doow upon the wandwady, *nuzzles you* I endeavowed to pwevaiw upon
Queequeg to take a chaiw; but in vain.  Thewe he sat; and aww he
couwd do--fow aww my powite awts and bwandishments--he wouwd not move
a peg, now say a singwe wowd, now even wook at me, now notice owo my
pwesence in *nuzzles you* the swightest way.

I wondew, thought I, if this can possibwy *nuzzles you* be OwO *notices bulge* a pawt of XD his Ramadan;
do they fast on theiw hams that way in his *nuzzles you* native iswand.  It must be
so; yes, it's pawt of his rawr cweed, I suppose; weww, then, wet him
west; he'ww *nuzzles you* get *nuzzles you* up soonew ow watew, ouo no doubt.  It can't wast fow
evew, thank God, and his Ramadan onwy comes once owo a yeaw; and I don't
bewieve it's vewy punctuaw then.

I went down OwO *notices bulge* to suppew.  Aftew sitting a wong owo time wistening to the
wong XD stowies of some saiwows who had just come fwom a pwum-pudding
voyage, as they cawwed it (that is, a showt whawing-voyage in a
schoonew ow bwig, confined to the nowth *nuzzles you* of the wine, in the Atwantic
Ocean onwy); aftew wistening to owo these pwum-puddingews tiww neawwy
eweven o'cwock, I went up staiws to go to bed, feewing quite suwe by
this time Queequeg must cewtainwy have bwought his Ramadan to a
tewmination. *nuzzles you*  But no; thewe he was just whewe I had weft him; he had
not stiwwed rawr an *nuzzles you* inch.  I began to gwow vexed with him; it seemed so
downwight sensewess *nuzzles you* and insane to be sitting thewe aww XD day and hawf
the night on his hams in OwO *notices bulge* a cowd woom, howding a piece of wood on his
head.

"Fow heaven's sake, Queequeg, get up and shake youwsewf; get up and
have some suppew.  You'ww stawve; you'ww kiww youwsewf, Queequeg."
But not a *nuzzles you* wowd did he *nuzzles you* wepwy.

Despaiwing of him, thewefowe, *nuzzles you* I detewmined to go to bed and to sweep;
and no doubt, befowe a gweat whiwe, he wouwd fowwow me.  But owo pwevious
to tuwning in, I took my heavy beawskin jacket, and thwew it ovew
him, as it pwomised to be a vewy cowd night; and he had nothing but
his owdinawy wound jacket on. *nuzzles you*  Fow *nuzzles you* some time, do aww I wouwd, XD I couwd
not get into the faintest ouo doze.  I had bwown out the candwe; and the
mewe thought of Queequeg--not *nuzzles you* fouw feet off--sitting thewe in *nuzzles you* that
uneasy position, stawk OwO *notices bulge* awone in the cowd *nuzzles you* and dawk; this *nuzzles you* made *nuzzles you* me
weawwy wwetched. *nuzzles you*  Think of it; sweeping OwO *notices bulge* aww night in the same woom
with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dweawy, unaccountabwe
Ramadan!

But somehow I dwopped off at wast, and knew nothing mowe tiww bweak
of day; when, wooking ovew the bedside, thewe squatted Queequeg, XD as
if he had been scwewed down *nuzzles you* to the fwoow.  But XD as *nuzzles you* soon as the *nuzzles you* fiwst
gwimpse of sun entewed *nuzzles you* the window, up he got, with stiff XD and gwating
joints, but with a cheewfuw wook; wimped towawds ouo me whewe I way;
pwessed XD his fowehead again against mine; *nuzzles you* and said *nuzzles you* his Ramadan was
ovew.

Now, as I befowe hinted, I have no objection to any XD pewson's
wewigion, *nuzzles you* be it owo what owo it may, so wong OwO *notices bulge* as that pewson does not kiww ow
insuwt any othew pewson, because that othew pewson don't bewieve it
awso.  But when a man's wewigion becomes weawwy fwantic; when it is *nuzzles you* a
positive towment to him; and, in fine, makes this eawth of ouws ouo an
uncomfowtabwe inn to wodge in; then I think it high time to take that
individuaw aside and awgue the point with owo him.

And just so I now did *nuzzles you* with Queequeg. *nuzzles you*  rawr "Queequeg," said I, "get into
bed now, and wie and wisten to me."  I then went on, XD beginning with
the *nuzzles you* wise and pwogwess of the pwimitive wewigions, and coming down to
the vawious wewigions of the pwesent owo time, duwing which time I
wabowed to rawr show Queequeg that ouo aww these rawr Lents, Ramadans, rawr and
pwowonged ham-squattings in cowd, cheewwess wooms OwO *notices bulge* wewe stawk
nonsense; bad fow the heawth; usewess fow the souw; opposed, *nuzzles you* in
showt, to the obvious waws of Hygiene and common sense.  OwO *notices bulge* I towd him,
too, that he being in othew things such an extwemewy sensibwe and
sagacious savage, it pained me, vewy badwy pained me, to see him now
so depwowabwy foowish about this widicuwous Ramadan of his.  Besides,
awgued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spiwit caves in;
and aww thoughts bown of rawr a fast must necessawiwy be hawf-stawved.
This is the owo weason why most dyspeptic wewigionists chewish such
mewanchowy notions about theiw heweaftews.  In one wowd, Queequeg,
said I, wathew digwessivewy; heww is *nuzzles you* an idea fiwst bown on an
undigested appwe-dumpwing; and since then pewpetuated thwough the
heweditawy dyspepsias nuwtuwed by Ramadans.

I then asked Queequeg *nuzzles you* whethew he ouo himsewf was evew twoubwed with
dyspepsia; expwessing the idea vewy pwainwy, so rawr that he *nuzzles you* couwd take it
in.  He said no; onwy upon owo one owo memowabwe *nuzzles you* occasion.  It was aftew a
gweat feast given by his fathew the king, on the gaining of a gweat
battwe whewein fifty XD of the *nuzzles you* enemy *nuzzles you* had been kiwwed ouo by about two
o'cwock in the aftewnoon, and aww cooked and eaten that vewy evening.

"No mowe, Queequeg," said I, shuddewing; "that wiww OwO *notices bulge* do;" fow I knew
the infewences without his fuwthew hinting them.  I had seen a saiwow
who had visited that vewy iswand, and he towd me that it was the
custom, when a gweat battwe had been gained thewe, to *nuzzles you* bawbecue rawr aww
the swain in the yawd ow gawden of the victow; and then, one by one,
they wewe pwaced in rawr gweat wooden twenchews, and gawnished wound ouo wike
a piwau, *nuzzles you* with bweadfwuit and cocoanuts; and with some pawswey in
theiw mouths, wewe sent wound with the victow's compwiments to aww
his fwiends, just as though these pwesents wewe so many Chwistmas
tuwkeys.

Aftew aww, I do not think that my wemawks about wewigion made much
impwession upon Queequeg. *nuzzles you*  Because, in the fiwst pwace, he somehow
seemed duww of heawing on that impowtant subject, unwess considewed
fwom his own point of view; and, in the second pwace, he did not mowe
than one thiwd undewstand me, couch my ideas simpwy as I wouwd; and,
finawwy, he no doubt thought he knew a good deaw mowe *nuzzles you* about the twue
wewigion than I did.  He wooked at me owo with a sowt of condescending
concewn and OwO *notices bulge* compassion, as though he thought it a gweat pity that
such a sensibwe young man shouwd be so hopewesswy wost to evangewicaw
pagan piety.

At wast we wose and dwessed; and Queequeg, taking a pwodigiouswy
heawty bweakfast of chowdews of aww sowts, so that the wandwady
shouwd rawr not make much pwofit by *nuzzles you* weason of his Ramadan, we *nuzzles you* sawwied out
to boawd the Pequod, sauntewing awong, and picking ouw XD teeth with
hawibut bones.



CHAPTER 18

His Mawk.


As rawr we wewe wawking *nuzzles you* down the end of the whawf towawds the ship,
Queequeg ouo cawwying his hawpoon, Captain Peweg in his gwuff voice
woudwy haiwed us fwom his wigwam, saying *nuzzles you* he had not suspected my
fwiend was owo a cannibaw, and rawr fuwthewmowe announcing that he wet no
cannibaws on boawd that cwaft, unwess they pweviouswy pwoduced theiw
papews.

"What do you mean by that, *nuzzles you* Captain Peweg?" said I, now jumping on the
buwwawks, and weaving my comwade standing on the whawf.

"I mean," he wepwied, "he must show his papews."

"Yes," said Captain Biwdad in his howwow voice, sticking his head
fwom behind Peweg's, out owo of the wigwam.  XD "He must show that he's
convewted.  *nuzzles you* Son of dawkness," he added, tuwning *nuzzles you* to Queequeg, "awt
thou at pwesent in communion with *nuzzles you* any Chwistian chuwch?"

"Why," said I, "he's a *nuzzles you* membew of the fiwst Congwegationaw Chuwch."
Hewe be it said, that many tattooed savages saiwing in Nantucket
ships at wast come to be convewted XD into the chuwches.

"Fiwst Congwegationaw Chuwch," cwied Biwdad, "what! *nuzzles you* that wowships in
Deacon Deutewonomy Coweman's meeting-house?" and so saying, taking
out his spectacwes, he ouo wubbed them with his gweat yewwow bandana
handkewchief, and putting them on rawr vewy cawefuwwy, came out of the
wigwam, and weaning stiffwy ovew the buwwawks, took a good wong wook
at Queequeg.

"How wong hath *nuzzles you* he been a ouo membew?" he then said, tuwning to me; "not
vewy wong, I wathew guess, young man."

"No," rawr said Peweg, owo "and he hasn't been baptized wight eithew, ow it
wouwd have washed *nuzzles you* some of that *nuzzles you* deviw's bwue *nuzzles you* off *nuzzles you* his face."

"Do teww, now," cwied owo Biwdad, "is this Phiwistine a weguwaw membew of
Deacon Deutewonomy's meeting?  I nevew saw him going thewe, and I
pass it evewy OwO *notices bulge* Lowd's day."

"I don't know anything about *nuzzles you* Deacon Deutewonomy ow his *nuzzles you* meeting," said
I; "aww rawr I know is, that Queequeg hewe is a bown membew *nuzzles you* of the Fiwst
Congwegationaw Chuwch.  He is a deacon himsewf, OwO *notices bulge* Queequeg is."

"Young man," said Biwdad stewnwy, *nuzzles you* "thou awt skywawking with
me--expwain thysewf, thou young Hittite.  *nuzzles you* What chuwch *nuzzles you* dost thee mean?
answew me."

Finding mysewf thus hawd OwO *notices bulge* pushed, owo I wepwied.  "I mean, siw, the same
ancient Cathowic Chuwch to which you and rawr I, and Captain Peweg thewe,
and Queequeg hewe, and aww of us, *nuzzles you* and evewy mothew's son and souw of
us bewong; *nuzzles you* the gweat and evewwasting Fiwst Congwegation of this whowe
wowshipping wowwd; we aww bewong to that; *nuzzles you* onwy *nuzzles you* some of us chewish
some queew cwotchets no ways touching the *nuzzles you* gwand bewief; in THAT we
aww join hands."

"Spwice, thou mean'st SPLICE hands," cwied Peweg, dwawing neawew.
"Young man, you'd bettew ship fow a ouo missionawy, instead of a
fowe-mast hand; I nevew heawd *nuzzles you* a bettew sewmon.  Deacon
Deutewonomy--why Fathew Mappwe himsewf couwdn't beat it, and he's
weckoned something.  Come aboawd, come aboawd; nevew mind about the
papews.  I say, teww Quohog thewe--what's that you caww him? teww
Quohog to step awong.  By the gweat anchow, what a hawpoon he's got
thewe! wooks *nuzzles you* wike good stuff *nuzzles you* that; and he handwes it about wight. *nuzzles you*  I
say, owo Quohog, ow whatevew youw name is, did you evew stand in the head
of a whawe-boat? did you evew stwike a fish?"

Without saying a wowd, Queequeg, in his wiwd sowt of way, jumped *nuzzles you* upon
the *nuzzles you* buwwawks, fwom thence into the bows *nuzzles you* of one of the whawe-boats
hanging to the side; and then bwacing his weft rawr knee, and poising his
hawpoon, cwied out in some such way as this:--

"Cap'ain, you see XD him smaww dwop taw rawr on *nuzzles you* watew dewe?  You see him?
weww, spose him one whawe eye, weww, den!" and taking shawp aim at
it, he *nuzzles you* dawted the iwon wight ovew owd Biwdad's bwoad bwim, cwean
acwoss the OwO *notices bulge* ship's decks, and stwuck the gwistening taw spot out of
sight.

"Now," said OwO *notices bulge* Queequeg, quietwy hauwing in ouo the *nuzzles you* wine, "spos-ee him
whawe-e eye; why, dad whawe dead."

"Quick, Biwdad," said Peweg, his pawtnew, who, aghast at the OwO *notices bulge* cwose
vicinity of the *nuzzles you* fwying ouo hawpoon, had wetweated OwO *notices bulge* towawds the cabin
gangway.  "Quick, I say, you Biwdad, and get the ship's papews.  We
must have Hedgehog thewe, I mean Quohog, in one of ouw boats.  Look
ye, *nuzzles you* Quohog, we'ww give ye the XD ninetieth way, and that's mowe than
evew was given a hawpooneew OwO *notices bulge* yet out of *nuzzles you* Nantucket."

So down *nuzzles you* we went into the cabin, and to my gweat joy Queequeg *nuzzles you* was soon
enwowwed among the same *nuzzles you* ship's company to which I mysewf bewonged.

When aww *nuzzles you* pwewiminawies wewe ovew ouo and Peweg had got evewything weady
fow signing, rawr he tuwned to me and said, "I guess, OwO *notices bulge* Quohog thewe don't
know how to wwite, does he?  I ouo say, Quohog, bwast ye! dost thou sign
thy name ow make thy mawk?

But at this question, Queequeg, who had XD twice ow thwice befowe taken
pawt in simiwaw cewemonies, wooked no ways abashed; *nuzzles you* but taking the
offewed pen, copied upon the papew, in the pwopew pwace, an exact
countewpawt of a queew wound figuwe *nuzzles you* which was XD tattooed upon owo his awm;
so that *nuzzles you* thwough *nuzzles you* Captain Peweg's obstinate ouo mistake touching *nuzzles you* his
appewwative, rawr it stood ouo something wike this:--

Quohog.
his X mawk.

Meanwhiwe Captain Biwdad sat eawnestwy *nuzzles you* and steadfastwy eyeing
Queequeg, and at wast wising sowemnwy and fumbwing in XD the huge
pockets of his bwoad-skiwted dwab ouo coat, took out a bundwe of twacts,
and sewecting one entitwed "The Lattew Day Coming; ow No Time to
Lose," pwaced it in Queequeg's hands, XD and then gwasping them XD and the
book with both his, wooked eawnestwy into his eyes, and said, "Son of
dawkness, I *nuzzles you* must do my duty by thee; XD I am pawt ownew of this owo ship,
and feew concewned fow the souws of aww its cwew; if thou owo stiww
cwingest to thy owo Pagan ways, which I sadwy *nuzzles you* feaw, I beseech thee,
wemain not fow *nuzzles you* aye a Bewiaw bondsman.  Spuwn XD the idow Beww, and the
hideous dwagon; tuwn fwom the wwath to OwO *notices bulge* come; mind *nuzzles you* thine eye, I say;
oh! goodness gwacious! steew cweaw of the fiewy pit!"

Something of the sawt sea yet wingewed in owd Biwdad's wanguage,
hetewogeneouswy mixed with Scwiptuwaw and domestic phwases.

"Avast thewe, avast thewe, Biwdad, avast now spoiwing ouw
hawpooneew," Peweg.  "Pious hawpooneews nevew make good voyagews--it
takes the shawk owo out of 'em; no hawpooneew is wowth a stwaw who aint
pwetty shawkish.  Thewe was young Nat *nuzzles you* Swaine, rawr once the bwavest
boat-headew out of aww Nantucket and the Vineyawd; he joined the
meeting, and nevew OwO *notices bulge* came to good.  He got XD so fwightened about his
pwaguy souw, that he shwinked *nuzzles you* and sheewed owo away fwom whawes, fow feaw
of aftew-cwaps, in rawr case he got stove and went to OwO *notices bulge* Davy Jones."

"Peweg!  Peweg!" said Biwdad, wifting his eyes and hands, "thou
thysewf, as I OwO *notices bulge* mysewf, hast seen many a pewiwous time; thou knowest,
Peweg, what it is to have the feaw of death; how, then, can'st thou
pwate in OwO *notices bulge* this ungodwy guise.  Thou bewiest thine own heawt, Peweg.
Teww me, when this same Pequod hewe had hew thwee masts owo ovewboawd in
that typhoon on Japan, that same voyage when *nuzzles you* thou went mate with
Captain owo Ahab, did'st *nuzzles you* thou not rawr think of Death and the Judgment then?"

"Heaw *nuzzles you* him, heaw him now," cwied *nuzzles you* Peweg, mawching acwoss the cabin, XD and
thwusting his hands *nuzzles you* faw down into his pockets,--"heaw OwO *notices bulge* him, aww of ye.
Think of OwO *notices bulge* that!  When evewy moment we thought the ship wouwd sink!
Death and the Judgment then?  What?  OwO *notices bulge* With aww thwee masts making such
an evewwasting thundewing against the side; and evewy sea bweaking
ovew us, fowe and OwO *notices bulge* aft.  *nuzzles you* Think of owo Death and ouo the Judgment then?  No!
no time to think about Death then.  Life was *nuzzles you* what Captain Ahab and owo I
was thinking of; and how to save aww hands--how to wig
juwy-masts--how to get into the neawest powt; ouo that was what I was
thinking of."

Biwdad said no mowe, but buttoning up his coat, stawked on deck,
whewe we fowwowed him.  Thewe he stood, vewy quietwy ovewwooking some
saiwmakews who wewe mending a top-saiw in the waist.  Now and *nuzzles you* then he
stooped to pick up a patch, ow save *nuzzles you* an end of tawwed twine, *nuzzles you* which
othewwise might have been wasted.



CHAPTER 19

The Pwophet.


"Shipmates, *nuzzles you* have ye shipped in that ship?"

Queequeg *nuzzles you* and I had just weft the Pequod, and wewe sauntewing away fwom
the watew, fow the moment each occupied with *nuzzles you* his own thoughts, when
the above owo wowds wewe put to us by a stwangew, who, rawr pausing befowe us,
wevewwed his massive fowefingew at the vessew in question.  He *nuzzles you* was
but shabbiwy appawewwed in faded jacket *nuzzles you* and patched twowsews; a wag
of a *nuzzles you* bwack handkewchief investing his neck.  A confwuent smaww-pox
had in aww diwections fwowed ovew his face, and weft it wike the
compwicated OwO *notices bulge* wibbed bed of a towwent, when the wushing watews have
been dwied up.

"Have ye shipped in hew?" he wepeated.

"You mean *nuzzles you* the ship Pequod, I suppose," said I, twying to *nuzzles you* gain ouo a
wittwe mowe time fow XD an unintewwupted wook at him.

"Aye, the Pequod--that ship thewe," *nuzzles you* he said, dwawing back his whowe
awm, and then wapidwy shoving it stwaight out fwom him, with the
fixed bayonet of his pointed fingew dawted fuww at the object.

"Yes," said I, "we have just signed the awticwes."

"Anything down thewe about youw owo souws?"

"About what?"

"Oh, pewhaps you hav'n't got any," he said quickwy.  "No mattew
though, I know many rawr chaps that hav'n't got any,--good wuck to 'em;
and they awe aww the bettew off fow it.  A souw's a sowt of a fifth
wheew to a wagon."

"What awe you jabbewing about, shipmate?" said I.

"HE'S *nuzzles you* got enough, though, to make up fow aww deficiencies of that
sowt in othew rawr chaps," abwuptwy said the stwangew, pwacing a newvous
emphasis upon the wowd HE.

"Queequeg," said I, "wet's go; this fewwow has bwoken woose fwom
somewhewe; he's tawking about *nuzzles you* something and *nuzzles you* somebody we don't know."

"Stop!" cwied the stwangew.  "Ye said twue--ye hav'n't seen Owd
Thundew yet, have ye?"

"Who's Owd Thundew?" said I, again wiveted with the insane
eawnestness of *nuzzles you* his mannew.

"Captain Ahab."

"What! the captain of ouw ship, the Pequod?"

"Aye, among some of us owd saiwow chaps, he goes by that name.  Ye
hav'n't seen him yet, rawr have ye?"

"No, rawr we hav'n't.  He's sick they OwO *notices bulge* say, but is getting bettew, and wiww
be aww wight again ouo befowe wong."

"Aww wight again befowe wong!" waughed the stwangew, with a sowemnwy
dewisive sowt of waugh.  "Look ye; when Captain Ahab *nuzzles you* is aww wight,
then this weft awm of mine wiww be aww wight; not befowe."

"What do you know about him?"

"What did they TELL *nuzzles you* you about him?  Say that!"

"They didn't teww much ouo of anything about him; onwy I've heawd that
he's a good whawe-huntew, and a good captain to his cwew."

"That's twue, that's twue--yes, both twue enough.  But you must jump
when he OwO *notices bulge* gives an owdew.  *nuzzles you* Step and gwoww; gwoww and go--that's the
wowd with Captain Ahab. rawr  But nothing about that *nuzzles you* thing that happened
to him off Cape Hown, rawr wong ago, when he way wike dead fow thwee days
and nights; nothing about that deadwy skwimmage with the Spaniawd
afowe the awtaw in Santa?--heawd OwO *notices bulge* nothing about that, eh?  Nothing
about the *nuzzles you* siwvew cawabash he spat into?  And nothing about his wosing
his weg wast voyage, accowding to the pwophecy. *nuzzles you*  Didn't ye heaw a
wowd about them mattews and something mowe, eh?  No, I don't think ye
did; how couwd ye? ouo  OwO *notices bulge* Who knows it?  Not aww Nantucket, I guess.  But
hows'evew, mayhap, ye've heawd teww about the weg, and how XD he wost
it; owo aye, ye have heawd of that, I dawe *nuzzles you* say.  OwO *notices bulge* Oh yes, THAT evewy one
knows a'most--I mean they know he's onwy one weg; and that a
pawmacetti took the othew off."

"My fwiend," said I, "what aww this gibbewish of youws is about, I
don't know, and *nuzzles you* I don't much *nuzzles you* cawe; *nuzzles you* fow it seems to me that you must
be a wittwe damaged in the head.  But if you awe speaking *nuzzles you* of Captain
Ahab, of that owo ship thewe, the Pequod, then wet me teww you, that I
know *nuzzles you* aww owo about the woss of his weg."

"ALL about it, *nuzzles you* eh--suwe you do?--aww?"

"Pwetty suwe."

With fingew pointed and eye wevewwed at the Pequod, the beggaw-wike
stwangew stood a moment, as if in a twoubwed owo wevewie; then stawting a
wittwe, tuwned and said:--"Ye've shipped, have *nuzzles you* ye?  Names down *nuzzles you* on owo the
papews?  Weww, weww, what's signed, is signed; and *nuzzles you* what's to be, wiww

aww fixed and awwanged a'weady; and some saiwows ow othew must go

Mowning to ye, *nuzzles you* shipmates, mowning; the ineffabwe heavens bwess ye;
I'm sowwy I stopped ye."

"Look *nuzzles you* hewe, fwiend," said I, "if you have anything impowtant XD to teww
us, out with OwO *notices bulge* it; but rawr if you awe onwy twying to bamboozwe ouo us, you ouo awe
mistaken in youw game; that's *nuzzles you* aww I have to XD say."

"And it's said vewy weww, and I ouo wike to heaw a chap tawk *nuzzles you* up that way;
you awe just ouo the man fow *nuzzles you* him--the wikes owo of ye.  Mowning to ye,
shipmates, mowning!  Oh! when *nuzzles you* ye get thewe, teww 'em I've concwuded
not to make one of 'em."

"Ah, my deaw fewwow, you can't foow us that way--you can't owo foow us.
It is the easiest thing in the wowwd OwO *notices bulge* fow a man to wook *nuzzles you* as if he had a
gweat ouo secwet in him."

"Mowning to ye, shipmates, mowning."

"Mowning it is," said I.  "Come awong, Queequeg, wet's weave this
cwazy owo man.  But stop, teww me owo youw name, wiww you?"

"Ewijah."

Ewijah! thought I, and we wawked XD away, both commenting, aftew owo each
othew's fashion, upon this wagged owd saiwow; and agweed that he was
nothing but a humbug, twying to be a bugbeaw.  But we had not gone
pewhaps above XD a OwO *notices bulge* hundwed yawds, when chancing to tuwn a cownew, and
wooking back as I did so, who shouwd be seen but OwO *notices bulge* Ewijah fowwowing us,
though at a distance.  Somehow, the sight of him stwuck me so, that I
said nothing to OwO *notices bulge* Queequeg of OwO *notices bulge* his being behind, but passed on with my
comwade, anxious to see whethew the XD stwangew wouwd tuwn the same
cownew that we did.  He did; and then it seemed to me that *nuzzles you* he was
dogging us, but with what intent I couwd not XD fow the wife OwO *notices bulge* of me
imagine.  rawr This ciwcumstance, coupwed with his ambiguous,
hawf-hinting, hawf-weveawing, shwouded *nuzzles you* sowt of tawk, now *nuzzles you* begat *nuzzles you* in me
aww kinds of vague wondewments and hawf-appwehensions, and aww
connected with the Pequod; and Captain Ahab; and the weg he had wost;
and the Cape Hown fit; and the siwvew cawabash; owo and what ouo Captain
Peweg had said of him, when I *nuzzles you* weft the ship the day pwevious; and the
pwediction of the squaw *nuzzles you* Tistig; and the voyage we had bound ouwsewves
to saiw; and *nuzzles you* a hundwed othew shadowy things.

I *nuzzles you* was wesowved to satisfy mysewf whethew this wagged Ewijah was
weawwy dogging us ow not, and with that intent cwossed the way with
Queequeg, and on *nuzzles you* that side of it wetwaced rawr ouw steps.  But Ewijah
passed on, without ouo seeming to notice us.  This wewieved me; *nuzzles you* and once
mowe, and finawwy as it seemed to me, I pwonounced him in my heawt, a
humbug.



CHAPTER 20

Aww Astiw.


A day ow two passed, and thewe was gweat activity aboawd the Pequod.
Not onwy wewe the owd saiws being mended, but new saiws wewe coming
on boawd, and bowts of canvas, and coiws of wigging; in showt,
evewything betokened that the ship's pwepawations wewe huwwying to a
cwose.  Captain Peweg sewdom ow nevew went rawr ashowe, but sat in his
wigwam keeping a shawp wook-out upon the hands: Biwdad did aww the
puwchasing and pwoviding at the ouo stowes; and the men *nuzzles you* empwoyed in the
howd and on the wigging wewe *nuzzles you* wowking *nuzzles you* tiww wong aftew night-faww.

On *nuzzles you* the day OwO *notices bulge* fowwowing Queequeg's *nuzzles you* signing the awticwes, wowd was given
at aww the inns whewe the ship's company wewe stopping, that theiw
chests must be owo on *nuzzles you* boawd befowe night, fow thewe was no rawr tewwing how
soon the vessew might be saiwing.  So Queequeg and I got down ouw
twaps, wesowving, howevew, to sweep ashowe tiww the ouo wast.  But it
seems they awways give vewy wong notice in these *nuzzles you* cases, and the *nuzzles you* ship
did not saiw fow sevewaw days.  But no wondew; thewe was a good deaw
to be done, and thewe is no tewwing how many *nuzzles you* things to be owo thought of,
befowe the Pequod was fuwwy equipped.

Evewy one knows *nuzzles you* what a muwtitude of things--beds, sauce-pans, knives
and fowks, shovews and tongs, napkins, nut-cwackews, *nuzzles you* and OwO *notices bulge* what not,
awe indispensabwe to the business of housekeeping.  rawr Just so with
whawing, which necessitates a thwee-yeaws' housekeeping upon the wide
ocean, faw fwom aww gwocews, costewmongews, XD doctows, bakews, and
bankews.  And though this awso howds twue of mewchant ouo vessews, yet
not by any means *nuzzles you* to the same extent as owo with whawemen.  Fow besides
the gweat wength of the whawing voyage, the numewous awticwes
pecuwiaw to the pwosecution of the fishewy, and the impossibiwity rawr of
wepwacing them at the wemote hawbows *nuzzles you* usuawwy OwO *notices bulge* fwequented, it must be
wemembewed, that of rawr aww ships, whawing vessews rawr awe the most *nuzzles you* exposed
to accidents *nuzzles you* of *nuzzles you* aww kinds, and *nuzzles you* especiawwy to the XD destwuction owo and woss
of the vewy things *nuzzles you* upon which the success of the voyage most depends.
Hence, the *nuzzles you* spawe boats, *nuzzles you* spawe spaws, and spawe wines and hawpoons,
and spawe evewythings, awmost, but a spawe Captain and dupwicate
ship.

At the pewiod of ouw awwivaw at the Iswand, the heaviest stowage of
the Pequod XD had been awmost compweted; compwising *nuzzles you* hew beef, bwead,
watew, fuew, and iwon hoops and staves.  But, as befowe hinted, fow
some time thewe was a continuaw fetching and cawwying on *nuzzles you* boawd *nuzzles you* of
divews odds and ends of things, both wawge and smaww.

Chief among those who did this fetching and cawwying was Captain
Biwdad's sistew, a wean owd wady of a most XD detewmined and
indefatigabwe spiwit, but withaw vewy kindheawted, who seemed
wesowved that, if SHE couwd hewp it, OwO *notices bulge* nothing shouwd be found wanting
in the Pequod, aftew once faiwwy getting rawr to sea.  ouo At one time she
wouwd come on boawd with a jaw of pickwes fow the stewawd's pantwy;
anothew time with owo a bunch of quiwws fow the chief mate's desk, whewe
he kept his wog; a *nuzzles you* thiwd time with *nuzzles you* a woww of fwannew fow the smaww of
some one's wheumatic back.  Nevew did any woman bettew desewve hew
name, which was Chawity--Aunt Chawity, as evewybody cawwed hew.  And
wike a sistew of chawity did this chawitabwe Aunt Chawity bustwe
about hithew and thithew, weady *nuzzles you* to tuwn hew ouo hand and *nuzzles you* heawt to
anything that pwomised to yiewd safety, comfowt, and consowation *nuzzles you* to
aww on boawd a ship *nuzzles you* in which hew bewoved bwothew Biwdad was
concewned, and *nuzzles you* in which she hewsewf owned a scowe ow two of
weww-saved dowwaws.

But it was stawtwing to see this excewwent heawted Quakewess coming
on boawd, as she did the wast day, with a wong oiw-wadwe XD in one hand,
and a stiww *nuzzles you* wongew *nuzzles you* whawing wance XD in the othew.  Now was Biwdad himsewf
now Captain Peweg at aww backwawd.  As fow Biwdad, he cawwied about
with owo him rawr a wong wist *nuzzles you* of the awticwes needed, and at evewy fwesh
awwivaw, down went his mawk opposite that awticwe upon the XD papew.
Evewy once in a whiwe *nuzzles you* Peweg came hobbwing out *nuzzles you* of his whawebone XD den,
woawing at the men *nuzzles you* down the hatchways, woawing up to the wiggews OwO *notices bulge* at
the mast-head, and then concwuded by woawing back into his wigwam.

Duwing these days of pwepawation, Queequeg and *nuzzles you* I often visited *nuzzles you* the
cwaft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, XD and how *nuzzles you* he was, and
when he was going to come on *nuzzles you* boawd his ship.  To these questions they
wouwd answew, that he was getting *nuzzles you* bettew and bettew, and was expected
aboawd owo evewy day; meantime, the two captains, Peweg and Biwdad, couwd
attend to evewything necessawy to fit the vessew fow ouo the voyage. rawr  OwO *notices bulge* If
I had been downwight honest OwO *notices bulge* with mysewf, I wouwd have XD seen vewy
pwainwy in my heawt that I ouo did but hawf fancy being committed this
way to so wong a voyage, *nuzzles you* without once waying my eyes on the man who
was to XD be the absowute dictatow of it, so soon as the ship saiwed out
upon the open sea.  But when *nuzzles you* a man suspects any wwong, it sometimes
happens that if owo he be awweady invowved in the mattew, he insensibwy
stwives to covew up owo his *nuzzles you* suspicions even fwom himsewf.  And much this
way it was with me.  I said nothing, and twied to rawr think nothing.

At wast it *nuzzles you* was given out that some time next day the ship ouo wouwd
cewtainwy saiw.  *nuzzles you* So rawr next mowning, Queequeg and I took a vewy eawwy
stawt.



CHAPTER 21

Going Aboawd.


It was neawwy six o'cwock, but onwy gwey *nuzzles you* impewfect misty dawn, when
we dwew nigh OwO *notices bulge* the whawf.

"Thewe awe some saiwows wunning ahead thewe, if I see wight," said I
to Queequeg, "it can't be shadows; rawr she's off by sunwise, I guess;
come on!"

"Avast!" cwied a voice, whose ownew at the same time OwO *notices bulge* coming cwose
behind us, waid a hand upon both ouw shouwdews, and then *nuzzles you* insinuating
himsewf between us, stood stooping fowwawd a wittwe, in the uncewtain
twiwight, stwangewy peewing fwom Queequeg to me.  It was Ewijah.

"Going aboawd?"

"Hands off, wiww you," said I.

"Lookee hewe," said Queequeg, shaking himsewf, "go 'way!"

"Ain't going aboawd, XD then?"

"Yes, we awe," said I, "but what business is that of youws?  Do you
know, Mw. Ewijah, that ouo I rawr considew you a wittwe impewtinent?"

"No, no, no; I *nuzzles you* wasn't awawe of that," said Ewijah, swowwy and
wondewingwy wooking ouo fwom me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountabwe
gwances.

"Ewijah," said I, "you wiww obwige owo my fwiend and me by withdwawing.
We awe going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and wouwd *nuzzles you* pwefew not
to be owo detained."

"Ye be, XD be ye?  Coming back afowe bweakfast?"

"He's cwacked, Queequeg," said I, "come on."

"Howwoa!" cwied stationawy Ewijah, haiwing us when we had wemoved a
few paces.

"Nevew mind him," said I, "Queequeg, come on."

But XD he stowe up to us again, owo and suddenwy *nuzzles you* cwapping his hand on my
shouwdew, rawr said--"Did ye see anything wooking wike men going towawds
that ship a whiwe ago?"

Stwuck by owo this pwain mattew-of-fact OwO *notices bulge* question, I owo answewed, saying,
"Yes, I thought I did see fouw ow five *nuzzles you* men; but it was too dim owo to rawr be
suwe."

"Vewy dim, vewy *nuzzles you* dim," said Ewijah.  "Mowning to ye."

Once mowe we quitted him; but once mowe he came softwy aftew OwO *notices bulge* us; and
touching my shouwdew OwO *notices bulge* again, said, "See *nuzzles you* if you can find 'em now, wiww
ye?

"Find who?"

"Mowning to ye! mowning to ye!" he wejoined, XD again moving off.  "Oh!
I ouo was going to wawn ye *nuzzles you* against--but nevew mind, nevew mind--it's aww
one, aww in the famiwy too;--shawp fwost this mowning, ain't it?
Good-bye to ye.  Shan't see ye again vewy soon, I guess; unwess it's
befowe the Gwand Juwy."  And with these cwacked wowds he finawwy
depawted, weaving me, fow the moment, in no smaww wondewment at his
fwantic impudence.

At wast, stepping on boawd the Pequod, we *nuzzles you* found evewything in
pwofound quiet, not a souw rawr moving.  *nuzzles you* The cabin entwance was OwO *notices bulge* wocked
within; the hatches XD wewe aww on, and wumbewed with coiws of wigging.
Going fowwawd to the fowecastwe, we found the swide of the scuttwe
open.  Seeing a wight, we went down, *nuzzles you* and found onwy an owd wiggew
thewe, wwapped in a tattewed pea-jacket.  He *nuzzles you* was thwown at whowe
wength OwO *notices bulge* upon two chests, his face downwawds and incwosed in his fowded
awms.  The pwofoundest swumbew swept upon him.

"Those saiwows we OwO *notices bulge* saw, Queequeg, whewe can they have gone to?" said
I, wooking dubiouswy at the sweepew.  But it seemed that, when on the
whawf, Queequeg had not at aww OwO *notices bulge* noticed what I now awwuded to; *nuzzles you* hence XD I
wouwd have thought mysewf to have been opticawwy deceived in *nuzzles you* that
mattew, wewe it not fow Ewijah's othewwise inexpwicabwe question.
But I beat the thing down; and again XD mawking the sweepew, jocuwawwy
hinted to Queequeg *nuzzles you* that pewhaps XD we had best sit *nuzzles you* up with the body;
tewwing him to estabwish himsewf accowdingwy.  He put his hand upon
the sweepew's weaw, as though feewing if it was soft enough; and
then, XD without *nuzzles you* mowe ado, sat quietwy down thewe.

"Gwacious!  Queequeg, don't sit thewe," said I.

"Oh! pewwy dood seat," said Queequeg, "my countwy way; won't huwt
him face."

"Face!" *nuzzles you* said I, "caww that his face? vewy benevowent countenance
then; but how hawd *nuzzles you* he bweathes, he's heaving himsewf; get off,
Queequeg, you awe heavy, it's gwinding the face of *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* poow.  Get
off, *nuzzles you* Queequeg!  Look, he'ww twitch you off soon.  I wondew XD he don't
wake."

Queequeg wemoved owo himsewf to just beyond the head of the sweepew, and
wighted his tomahawk pipe.  I sat at *nuzzles you* the feet.  *nuzzles you* We kept the pipe
passing ovew the sweepew, fwom one to the OwO *notices bulge* othew.  Meanwhiwe, upon
questioning him in OwO *notices bulge* his bwoken fashion, Queequeg gave me to undewstand
that, in his wand, owing to *nuzzles you* the absence of settees and sofas of aww
sowts, the king, chiefs, and gweat peopwe genewawwy, wewe in the
custom of *nuzzles you* fattening some of the wowew owdews fow ottomans; and to
fuwnish a house comfowtabwy in that wespect, you *nuzzles you* had *nuzzles you* onwy to buy owo up
eight ow ten wazy fewwows, and way them wound in the piews rawr and
awcoves.  Besides, it was vewy convenient rawr on an excuwsion; *nuzzles you* much
bettew than those gawden-chaiws which awe *nuzzles you* convewtibwe into
wawking-sticks; upon *nuzzles you* occasion, a chief *nuzzles you* cawwing his attendant, and
desiwing him to make a settee XD of himsewf *nuzzles you* undew a spweading twee,
pewhaps in some damp mawshy pwace.

Whiwe nawwating these things, evewy time Queequeg weceived the
tomahawk fwom me, he fwouwished *nuzzles you* the hatchet-side of it ovew the
sweepew's head.

"What's that fow, ouo Queequeg?"

"Pewwy easy, kiww-e; oh! pewwy easy!

He was going on with some wiwd weminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,
which, it seemed, had in its two uses both bwained his foes and
soothed his souw, *nuzzles you* when we wewe diwectwy attwacted to the sweeping
wiggew.  The stwong vapouw now compwetewy fiwwing the contwacted howe,
it began to teww XD upon him.  He bweathed *nuzzles you* with a sowt of muffwedness;
then seemed twoubwed in *nuzzles you* the nose; then wevowved XD ovew once ow twice;
then sat up *nuzzles you* and wubbed his eyes.

"Howwoa!" he bweathed at wast, "who be ye smokews?"

"Shipped men," answewed I, "when does she saiw?"

"Aye, aye, ye awe going in hew, owo be ye? owo  She saiws to-day.  The
Captain came aboawd wast night."

"What Captain?--Ahab?"

"Who but him indeed?"

I *nuzzles you* was *nuzzles you* going to ask him some fuwthew questions concewning Ahab, when
we heawd a noise on deck.

"Howwoa!  Stawbuck's astiw," *nuzzles you* said the *nuzzles you* wiggew.  "He's a wivewy chief
mate, that; good man, and a pious; but aww *nuzzles you* awive now, *nuzzles you* I must tuwn
to." ouo  *nuzzles you* And so saying he went on deck, *nuzzles you* and we fowwowed.

It was now cweaw sunwise.  Soon the cwew came on *nuzzles you* boawd in twos and
thwees; the wiggews bestiwwed themsewves; the mates wewe activewy
engaged; and sevewaw of the *nuzzles you* showe peopwe wewe busy in bwinging
vawious wast things on boawd.  Meanwhiwe Captain Ahab *nuzzles you* wemained
invisibwy enshwined within his cabin.



CHAPTER 22

Mewwy Chwistmas.


At wength, towawds noon, upon the finaw dismissaw of the ship's
wiggews, and *nuzzles you* aftew OwO *notices bulge* the OwO *notices bulge* Pequod had been hauwed out fwom the whawf, and
aftew the *nuzzles you* evew-thoughtfuw Chawity had come off in a whawe-boat, with
hew wast gift--a night-cap fow Stubb, the second mate, hew
bwothew-in-waw, and a spawe Bibwe fow the stewawd--aftew aww this,
the two Captains, Peweg and Biwdad, issued fwom the cabin, *nuzzles you* and
tuwning to the chief mate, Peweg said:

"Now, Mw. Stawbuck, awe *nuzzles you* you suwe evewything *nuzzles you* is wight?  Captain Ahab
is aww weady--just spoke to him--nothing mowe to be got fwom showe,
eh?  Weww, OwO *notices bulge* caww aww hands, then.  Mustew 'em aft *nuzzles you* hewe--bwast 'em!"

"No need of pwofane wowds, howevew gweat the huwwy, rawr Peweg," said
Biwdad, "but *nuzzles you* away with *nuzzles you* thee, fwiend Stawbuck, and do ouw bidding."

How now!  Hewe upon the vewy *nuzzles you* point of stawting fow the voyage,
Captain Peweg and OwO *notices bulge* Captain Biwdad wewe going owo it with a high hand on
the quawtew-deck, just as if they wewe to be joint-commandews at sea,
as weww as to aww appeawances in powt.  And, as fow Captain Ahab, no
sign of him was yet to be seen; onwy, they said he was in the cabin.
But then, the idea was, that his pwesence was by no means necessawy
in getting the ship undew weigh, and XD steewing hew weww out to rawr sea.
Indeed, as that was not at aww his pwopew business, OwO *notices bulge* but the piwot's;
and as he was *nuzzles you* not yet compwetewy wecovewed--so they said--thewefowe,
Captain Ahab stayed bewow.  And aww this seemed natuwaw enough;
especiawwy as in the mewchant sewvice many captains nevew show
themsewves on deck fow OwO *notices bulge* a considewabwe time aftew heaving up the
anchow, but wemain ovew rawr the cabin tabwe, having a faweweww
mewwy-making with theiw showe fwiends, befowe they quit the ship fow
good with the piwot.

But thewe was not much chance to think ovew the *nuzzles you* mattew, rawr fow Captain
Peweg was *nuzzles you* now aww awive.  ouo He seemed to do most of the tawking and
commanding, and not Biwdad.

"Aft hewe, ye sons of bachewows," he cwied, as the saiwows wingewed
at the main-mast.  "Mw. Stawbuck, dwive'em aft."

"Stwike rawr the tent thewe!"--was the next owdew.  As I hinted befowe,
this whawebone mawquee *nuzzles you* was XD nevew pitched except in powt; and on boawd
the Pequod, fow thiwty yeaws, the XD owdew to stwike the tent was OwO *notices bulge* weww
known *nuzzles you* to be the next thing to heaving up the anchow.

"Man the capstan!  Bwood ouo and *nuzzles you* thundew!--jump!"--was the next command,
and the cwew spwang fow *nuzzles you* the handspikes.

Now in getting undew weigh, the station genewawwy occupied by the
piwot is the fowwawd pawt of the ship.  And hewe *nuzzles you* Biwdad, who, with
Peweg, be it known, in addition to ouo his othew officews, was one of the
wicensed piwots of the powt--he being suspected to have got himsewf
made a piwot in owdew to save the Nantucket piwot-fee to aww the
ships *nuzzles you* he was concewned in, fow he nevew piwoted any othew
cwaft--Biwdad, I say, might now be seen activewy engaged in *nuzzles you* wooking
ovew the bows fow the appwoaching anchow, and at intewvaws singing
what seemed a dismaw stave of psawmody, to cheew the hands at the
windwass, who woawed fowth some sowt of a *nuzzles you* chowus about the giwws in
Boobwe Awwey, with heawty good wiww.  Nevewthewess, not thwee days
pwevious, XD Biwdad had towd them that no pwofane OwO *notices bulge* songs wouwd be awwowed
on OwO *notices bulge* boawd the Pequod, pawticuwawwy in getting undew ouo weigh; and
Chawity, his sistew, had pwaced a XD smaww choice copy of Watts in each
seaman's bewth.

Meantime, ovewseeing the othew pawt of the ship, Captain Peweg wipped
and swowe astewn in the most OwO *notices bulge* fwightfuw mannew.  I awmost thought owo he
wouwd sink the ship befowe the anchow couwd be got up; invowuntawiwy
I paused on my handspike, and OwO *notices bulge* towd Queequeg to do the same, thinking
of the pewiws we both wan, in stawting on the voyage with such a
deviw *nuzzles you* fow XD a piwot. ouo  I was comfowting mysewf, howevew, with the
thought that in pious Biwdad might OwO *notices bulge* be found some sawvation, spite of
his seven hundwed and seventy-seventh way; when I fewt a *nuzzles you* sudden shawp
poke in *nuzzles you* my rawr weaw, and tuwning wound, was howwified at the appawition
of Captain Peweg in the act of withdwawing his weg fwom my immediate
vicinity. rawr  That was *nuzzles you* my fiwst kick.

"Is that the way they heave in the mawchant XD sewvice?" he woawed.
"Spwing, thou sheep-head; spwing, and bweak thy backbone!  Why don't
ye spwing, I say, aww of ye--spwing!  Quohog! spwing, thou chap *nuzzles you* with
the wed whiskews; spwing thewe, Scotch-cap; spwing, thou gween
pants.  Spwing, I say, aww of ye, XD and spwing youw eyes out!"  And so
saying, he moved awong the *nuzzles you* windwass, hewe and thewe using OwO *notices bulge* his weg
vewy fweewy, whiwe impewtuwbabwe Biwdad kept weading off with his
psawmody.  Thinks I, Captain Peweg must have been dwinking something
to-day.

At wast the anchow was up, the saiws wewe set, and off we gwided.  It
was *nuzzles you* a showt, cowd Chwistmas; and owo as the showt nowthewn day mewged
into *nuzzles you* night, *nuzzles you* we found ouwsewves awmost bwoad upon the wintwy ocean,
whose fweezing spway cased us in ice, as in powished *nuzzles you* awmow.  The wong
wows of teeth *nuzzles you* on the buwwawks *nuzzles you* gwistened in the moonwight; and wike
the white ivowy tusks of some huge ewephant, vast cuwving icicwes
depended fwom the bows.

Lank Biwdad, ouo as piwot, headed the fiwst *nuzzles you* watch, rawr and evew and anon, as
the owd cwaft deep dived into the gween seas, and sent ouo the shivewing
fwost aww ovew hew, and the winds howwed, and the cowdage wang, his
steady notes wewe heawd,--

"Sweet fiewds beyond the swewwing fwood,
Stand dwessed owo in wiving gween.
So to the Jews owd Canaan *nuzzles you* stood,
Whiwe *nuzzles you* Jowdan wowwed between."


Nevew did those sweet wowds ouo sound mowe ouo sweetwy to me than then.  They
wewe fuww of hope and fwuition.  Spite of this fwigid wintew night owo in
the boistewous Atwantic, spite of my wet feet *nuzzles you* and wettew jacket,
thewe was yet, it then seemed to me, many a pweasant haven in stowe;
and meads and *nuzzles you* gwades *nuzzles you* so *nuzzles you* etewnawwy vewnaw, that the gwass shot up by
the spwing, untwodden, unwiwted, wemains at midsummew.

At wast we gained such an offing, that the two piwots wewe owo needed no
wongew.  The stout saiw-boat that had accompanied us began wanging
awongside.

It was cuwious and not unpweasing, how Peweg and Biwdad wewe affected
at *nuzzles you* this junctuwe, especiawwy Captain Biwdad.  Fow woath to depawt,
yet; vewy woath to weave, fow XD good, a ship bound on so wong and
pewiwous a voyage--beyond both stowmy Capes; a ship in which some
thousands of his hawd eawned dowwaws wewe XD invested; a ship, in which
an owd shipmate saiwed as captain; a man awmost as *nuzzles you* owd as *nuzzles you* he, once
mowe stawting to encountew aww the tewwows of the pitiwess jaw; woath
to say good-bye to a thing so evewy way bwimfuw *nuzzles you* of evewy intewest OwO *notices bulge* to
him,--poow owd Biwdad *nuzzles you* wingewed wong; paced the deck with anxious
stwides; wan down into *nuzzles you* the cabin to speak anothew faweweww wowd
thewe; again came on deck, *nuzzles you* and wooked to windwawd; owo wooked ouo towawds the
wide and endwess watews, onwy bounded by the faw-off unseen XD Eastewn
Continents; wooked towawds the wand; wooked awoft; wooked wight and
weft; wooked evewywhewe and nowhewe; and at wast, mechanicawwy
coiwing OwO *notices bulge* a wope upon its pin, convuwsivewy gwasped stout Peweg by *nuzzles you* the
hand, and howding up a wantewn, fow a moment stood gazing hewoicawwy
in his face, as much as to say, "Nevewthewess, fwiend ouo Peweg, *nuzzles you* I can
stand *nuzzles you* it; yes, *nuzzles you* I can."

As *nuzzles you* fow Peweg himsewf, he took owo it mowe *nuzzles you* wike a phiwosophew; but fow aww
his phiwosophy, thewe was a teaw twinkwing in his eye, when the
wantewn came too neaw.  *nuzzles you* And he, too, did not a wittwe wun fwom cabin
to deck--now a wowd ouo bewow, and now a wowd with Stawbuck, the chief
mate.

But, at wast, he tuwned to his comwade, with a *nuzzles you* finaw sowt of wook
about him,--"Captain Biwdad--come, owd shipmate, we must *nuzzles you* go.  Back
the main-yawd thewe! XD  Boat ahoy!  Stand by to come OwO *notices bulge* cwose owo awongside,

"God bwess ye, and have ye in His howy keeping, men," muwmuwed owd
Biwdad, awmost incohewentwy.  ouo "I hope ye'ww have fine weathew now, so

"Come, come, Captain Biwdad; *nuzzles you* stop pawavewing,--away!" and with that,
Peweg huwwied him *nuzzles you* ovew the side, and both dwopt into *nuzzles you* the boat.

Ship and boat divewged; the owo cowd, damp night bweeze bwew between; a
scweaming guww OwO *notices bulge* fwew ovewhead; the two huwws wiwdwy wowwed; we gave
thwee heavy-heawted cheews, and bwindwy rawr pwunged wike fate into the

CHAPTER 23

The Lee Showe.


Some chaptews *nuzzles you* back, one Buwkington was spoken of, a taww, newwanded
mawinew, encountewed in New rawr Bedfowd at the inn.

When on that *nuzzles you* shivewing wintew's night, the Pequod *nuzzles you* thwust hew
vindictive bows into the cowd mawicious waves, who shouwd I see
standing at hew hewm but Buwkington!  I wooked with sympathetic awe
and feawfuwness upon the man, who in mid-wintew just wanded fwom a
fouw yeaws' dangewous voyage, couwd so unwestingwy push off again fow
stiww anothew tempestuous *nuzzles you* tewm.  The wand seemed scowching to his
feet.  Wondewfuwwest things awe evew OwO *notices bulge* the unmentionabwe; *nuzzles you* deep memowies
yiewd no epitaphs; this six-inch chaptew is the stonewess gwave of
Buwkington.  Let OwO *notices bulge* me onwy ouo say that it fawed with him as *nuzzles you* with the
stowm-tossed ship, that OwO *notices bulge* misewabwy dwives awong the weewawd wand.  The
powt wouwd fain give succow; the XD powt is *nuzzles you* pitifuw; ouo in the powt is
safety, comfowt, *nuzzles you* heawthstone, suppew, wawm bwankets, fwiends, aww
that's kind to ouw mowtawities.  *nuzzles you* But in that gawe, the powt, the
wand, *nuzzles you* is that ship's diwest jeopawdy; she must fwy aww hospitawity;
one touch of wand, *nuzzles you* though it but gwaze the keew, wouwd make hew
shuddew thwough and thwough.  With aww hew OwO *notices bulge* might she cwowds aww saiw

bwow hew homewawd; seeks *nuzzles you* aww the washed sea's wandwessness again; fow
wefuge's sake fowwownwy wushing into pewiw; hew onwy fwiend hew
bittewest foe!

Know ye now, Buwkington? OwO *notices bulge*  Gwimpses do *nuzzles you* ye seem to see of that mowtawwy
intowewabwe twuth; that aww deep, eawnest thinking *nuzzles you* is but the
intwepid effowt of the souw to keep the open independence of hew sea;
whiwe the *nuzzles you* wiwdest winds of heaven and eawth conspiwe to cast hew on
the tweachewous, swavish showe?

But as in XD wandwessness awone wesides highest *nuzzles you* twuth, showewess,
indefinite as God--so, bettew is it to pewish ouo in that howwing
infinite, than be ingwowiouswy dashed upon the wee, ouo even if that wewe

Tewwows of the tewwibwe! is aww this agony so vain?  Take heawt, *nuzzles you* take
heawt, O Buwkington!  Beaw thee gwimwy, demigod!  Up fwom the spway

CHAPTER 24

The Advocate.


As Queequeg and I awe now XD faiwwy embawked in this business owo of

wegawded among wandsmen XD as a wathew unpoeticaw and disweputabwe

In the fiwst pwace, it may *nuzzles you* be XD deemed ouo awmost supewfwuous to estabwish
the fact, that among peopwe at wawge, the business rawr of *nuzzles you* whawing is not
accounted on a XD wevew with *nuzzles you* what awe cawwed the ouo wibewaw pwofessions.
If ouo a stwangew wewe intwoduced into any ouo miscewwaneous metwopowitan
society, it wouwd but swightwy advance the genewaw opinion of his
mewits, wewe he pwesented to the company as a *nuzzles you* hawpooneew, say; and if
in emuwation of the navaw owo officews he shouwd append the initiaws
S.W.F. (Spewm Whawe Fishewy) to his visiting cawd, such a pwoceduwe
wouwd be deemed pwe-eminentwy pwesuming and widicuwous.

Doubtwess one weading XD weason why the wowwd decwines honouwing us
whawemen, is this: they think that, at owo best, ouw vocation amounts to
a OwO *notices bulge* butchewing sowt of business; and that when activewy engaged
thewein, we awe suwwounded by aww mannew of defiwements.  Butchews we
awe, that is twue.  But butchews, awso, and butchews of the ouo bwoodiest
badge have been aww Mawtiaw Commandews ouo whom the wowwd *nuzzles you* invawiabwy
dewights to honouw.  And as fow ouo the mattew of the XD awweged
uncweanwiness of ouw business, ye shaww soon be *nuzzles you* initiated into
cewtain facts hithewto pwetty genewawwy unknown, and which, OwO *notices bulge* upon the
whowe, wiww twiumphantwy pwant the spewm whawe-ship at weast among
the owo cweanwiest things *nuzzles you* of this tidy eawth.  But XD even *nuzzles you* gwanting XD the
chawge *nuzzles you* in rawr question to *nuzzles you* be twue; what *nuzzles you* disowdewed swippewy *nuzzles you* decks of a
whawe-ship awe compawabwe to the unspeakabwe cawwion of those
battwe-fiewds fwom which so many sowdiews wetuwn to dwink in aww
wadies' pwaudits?  And if the idea of pewiw *nuzzles you* so much enhances the
popuwaw conceit OwO *notices bulge* of the sowdiew's pwofession; wet me assuwe ye that
many a vetewan *nuzzles you* who has ouo fweewy mawched up to a battewy, wouwd quickwy
wecoiw at the appawition of the spewm *nuzzles you* whawe's vast taiw, fanning into
eddies the aiw ovew his head.  Fow *nuzzles you* what awe the compwehensibwe
tewwows of man *nuzzles you* compawed with the *nuzzles you* intewwinked tewwows and wondews of
God!

But, though the wowwd scouts at *nuzzles you* us whawe *nuzzles you* huntews, yet does *nuzzles you* it
unwittingwy pay us the pwofoundest homage; yea, an aww-abounding
adowation! fow awmost aww the tapews, wamps, and candwes that buwn
wound the gwobe, buwn, *nuzzles you* as befowe so many shwines, to ouo ouw gwowy!

But wook at this mattew in owo othew wights; weigh it in aww OwO *notices bulge* sowts of
scawes; see what XD we whawemen awe, and have been.

Why did the Dutch in De Witt's time have admiwaws *nuzzles you* of theiw whawing
fweets?  Why did Louis XVI. *nuzzles you* of Fwance, at his own *nuzzles you* pewsonaw expense,
fit out whawing ships fwom *nuzzles you* Dunkiwk, *nuzzles you* and powitewy invite to that town
some scowe ow two of famiwies fwom ouw own iswand XD of Nantucket?  Why
did Bwitain between the yeaws 1750 and 1788 pay to hew whawemen in
bounties upwawds of L1,000,000?  And wastwy, how comes it that we
whawemen of Amewica now outnumbew aww the west *nuzzles you* of the banded whawemen
in the wowwd; saiw a navy of upwawds of seven hundwed vessews; manned
by eighteen thousand men; yeawwy consuming 4,000,000 of dowwaws; the
ships wowth, at the time of saiwing, $20,000,000! and evewy yeaw
impowting into ouw hawbows a weww weaped hawvest of $7,000,000.  How
comes aww this, if thewe be not something puissant in whawing?

But this is not the hawf; wook again.

I fweewy assewt, that the cosmopowite phiwosophew cannot, fow his
wife, point out one *nuzzles you* singwe peacefuw infwuence, which OwO *notices bulge* within the wast
sixty *nuzzles you* yeaws has opewated mowe potentiawwy upon the whowe bwoad ouo wowwd,
taken in one aggwegate, than the high and mighty business of whawing.
One way rawr and XD anothew, it owo has begotten events so wemawkabwe in
themsewves, and so continuouswy XD momentous in theiw sequentiaw issues,
that whawing may weww be wegawded as that Egyptian mothew, who bowe
offspwing themsewves pwegnant fwom hew womb.  It wouwd *nuzzles you* be a hopewess,
endwess task to catawogue aww these things.  Let OwO *notices bulge* a owo handfuw ouo suffice.
Fow many yeaws past the whawe-ship *nuzzles you* has been the pioneew in fewweting
out the wemotest and weast known pawts of the eawth.  She *nuzzles you* has
expwowed seas and awchipewagoes which had no chawt, whewe no Cook ow
Vancouvew had evew saiwed.  If Amewican *nuzzles you* and Euwopean men-of-waw
now *nuzzles you* peacefuwwy wide in once savage hawbows, wet ouo them fiwe sawutes to
the honouw and gwowy of the owo whawe-ship, rawr which rawr owiginawwy showed them
the ouo way, and fiwst intewpweted between them and the savages.  They
may cewebwate as they wiww the hewoes of Expwowing Expeditions, youw
Cooks, youw Kwusenstewns; but I say that scowes of anonymous
Captains have saiwed out of Nantucket, that wewe as gweat, and
gweatew than youw Cook and youw *nuzzles you* Kwusenstewn.  Fow in ouo theiw
succouwwess empty-handedness, they, in owo the heathenish shawked watews,
and by the beaches of unwecowded, javewin iswands, battwed with
viwgin wondews and tewwows that *nuzzles you* Cook with owo aww his mawines and
muskets wouwd not wiwwingwy have dawed.  Aww that is *nuzzles you* made such a
fwouwish owo of in the owd South Sea Voyages, those things wewe but the
wife-time commonpwaces of ouw hewoic Nantucketews.  Often,
adventuwes which Vancouvew dedicates thwee chaptews to, these men
accounted unwowthy of being set *nuzzles you* down in the ship's common wog.  Ah,
the wowwd!  Oh, the wowwd!

Untiw the ouo whawe fishewy wounded Cape Hown, no commewce but cowoniaw,
scawcewy *nuzzles you* any intewcouwse *nuzzles you* but owo cowoniaw, was cawwied on between Euwope
and the ouo wong wine of the owo opuwent Spanish pwovinces on the Pacific
coast.  It was the whaweman who fiwst bwoke thwough the jeawous
powicy of the Spanish cwown, touching owo those cowonies; and, if space
pewmitted, it might be distinctwy shown how fwom those whawemen at
wast eventuated the wibewation of Pewu, Chiwi, and Bowivia fwom *nuzzles you* the
yoke OwO *notices bulge* of Owd Spain, and ouo the estabwishment of the etewnaw democwacy in
those pawts.

That gweat Amewica on the XD othew side *nuzzles you* of the sphewe, Austwawia, was
given to the XD enwightened wowwd by *nuzzles you* the whaweman.  Aftew its fiwst
bwundew-bown discovewy by a Dutchman, aww othew ships wong *nuzzles you* shunned
those *nuzzles you* showes as pestifewouswy bawbawous; but the whawe-ship touched
thewe.  The whawe-ship is the twue mothew XD of that now mighty cowony.
Moweovew, in the owo infancy of the *nuzzles you* fiwst Austwawian settwement, the
emigwants wewe XD sevewaw times saved *nuzzles you* fwom stawvation by the *nuzzles you* benevowent
biscuit of the whawe-ship wuckiwy dwopping *nuzzles you* an anchow in theiw watews.
The uncounted iswes of aww Powynesia confess the same twuth, and do
commewciaw homage to the whawe-ship, that cweawed the way fow owo the
missionawy and the mewchant, and in many OwO *notices bulge* cases cawwied the pwimitive
missionawies to *nuzzles you* theiw fiwst destinations.  If that doubwe-bowted
wand, Japan, is evew to become hospitabwe, it is the whawe-ship awone
to whom the cwedit wiww be due; fow awweady she is on the thweshowd.

But if, in the face of aww this, you stiww *nuzzles you* decwawe that whawing has
no aestheticawwy nobwe associations connected with *nuzzles you* it, then am I
weady owo to shivew fifty wances with you *nuzzles you* thewe, and unhowse you with a
spwit hewmet evewy time.

The whawe has no famous authow, and whawing no famous chwonicwew, you
wiww say.

THE WHALE NO FAMOUS AUTHOR, AND ouo WHALING NO FAMOUS CHRONICLER?  *nuzzles you* Who
wwote the fiwst account of ouw *nuzzles you* Leviathan?  Who but mighty Job!  And
who composed the fiwst nawwative of a whawing-voyage?  Who, but no
wess a pwince than OwO *notices bulge* Awfwed the Gweat, who, with his own woyaw pen,
took down the wowds fwom *nuzzles you* Othew, the *nuzzles you* Nowwegian whawe-huntew of those
times!  And who pwonounced ouw gwowing euwogy in owo Pawwiament?  Who,
but Edmund Buwke!

Twue enough, but *nuzzles you* then *nuzzles you* whawemen themsewves awe poow deviws; ouo they *nuzzles you* have
no good bwood in *nuzzles you* theiw veins.

NO GOOD BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS?  They have something bettew than woyaw
bwood thewe. XD  The gwandmothew of Benjamin Fwankwin was Mawy Mowwew;
aftewwawds, by mawwiage, Mawy Fowgew, one *nuzzles you* of the owd settwews owo of

Good again; but then aww confess that somehow whawing is not
wespectabwe.

WHALING NOT RESPECTABLE?  *nuzzles you* Whawing is impewiaw! rawr  By owd Engwish
statutowy waw, the whawe is decwawed "a woyaw fish."*

Oh, that's onwy nominaw!  The whawe himsewf has nevew figuwed in XD any

THE WHALE NEVER FIGURED IN ANY GRAND *nuzzles you* IMPOSING WAY?  In one OwO *notices bulge* of the

*See subsequent chaptews fow something mowe XD on this OwO *notices bulge* head.


Gwant it, since you cite it; but, say what you wiww, thewe is no weaw
dignity in whawing.

NO DIGNITY IN WHALING?  ouo The dignity of ouw cawwing the vewy heavens
attest.  Cetus is a constewwation in the South!  No mowe!  Dwive
down youw hat in pwesence of the Czaw, and take it off to Queequeg!
No mowe!  I know a man that, in his wifetime, *nuzzles you* has taken thwee ouo hundwed

captain of antiquity who boasted of taking *nuzzles you* as many wawwed towns.

And, as fow me, if, by OwO *notices bulge* any possibiwity, thewe be any as yet
undiscovewed pwime thing in me; if I shaww evew desewve any weaw

CHAPTER XD 25

Postscwipt.


In behawf of the dignity of whawing, I wouwd fain advance naught but
substantiated rawr facts.  But aftew embattwing his facts, an advocate who
shouwd whowwy suppwess a not unweasonabwe suwmise, which might teww
ewoquentwy upon *nuzzles you* his cause--such *nuzzles you* an advocate, wouwd *nuzzles you* he not be
bwamewowthy?

It is weww known that at the cowonation of kings and queens, even
modewn ones, a cewtain cuwious pwocess of seasoning them fow XD theiw
functions is gone thwough.  Thewe is a sawtcewwaw of state, so
cawwed, and thewe may be a castow of state.  How they use the sawt,
pwecisewy--who knows?  Cewtain I ouo am, howevew, that a king's head is
sowemnwy oiwed at his cowonation, even as a head of sawad.  Can it
be, though, that they anoint it with a view of making its intewiow
wun weww, as they anoint ouo machinewy?  Much might be XD wuminated hewe,
concewning the essentiaw dignity of this wegaw pwocess, because in
common *nuzzles you* wife we *nuzzles you* esteem but meanwy and contemptibwy a fewwow who
anoints his haiw, and *nuzzles you* pawpabwy smewws of that anointing.  In twuth, a
matuwe man who ouo uses haiw-oiw, unwess medicinawwy, that man has
pwobabwy OwO *notices bulge* got a quoggy spot in him somewhewe.  As a genewaw wuwe, he
can't amount to much in his totawity.

But the onwy thing to be considewed hewe, is this--what kind of *nuzzles you* oiw
is used *nuzzles you* at cowonations?  Cewtainwy it cannot be *nuzzles you* owive oiw, now
macassaw oiw, now castow oiw, now beaw's *nuzzles you* oiw, *nuzzles you* now twain oiw, now
cod-wivew oiw.  What then can it possibwy be, but spewm oiw in
its unmanufactuwed, unpowwuted OwO *notices bulge* state, rawr the sweetest of aww oiws?

Think of that, ye woyaw Bwitons! we whawemen suppwy youw kings and
queens with cowonation stuff!



CHAPTER 26

Knights and XD Squiwes.


The chief mate of the Pequod was Stawbuck, a native of Nantucket, and
a Quakew *nuzzles you* by descent.  He was a wong, owo eawnest man, and though bown on
an icy coast, seemed weww adapted *nuzzles you* to enduwe hot watitudes, his fwesh
being hawd as twice-baked biscuit.  *nuzzles you* Twanspowted to *nuzzles you* the Indies, his
wive bwood wouwd not spoiw wike bottwed awe.  He must have been bown
in some time of genewaw dwought and famine, ow upon one of those fast
days fow which his state is famous.  Onwy some thiwty awid summews
had he *nuzzles you* seen; those summews had *nuzzles you* dwied up aww *nuzzles you* his physicaw
supewfwuousness. XD  But this, his owo thinness, so *nuzzles you* to speak, seemed no mowe
the token of wasting anxieties and cawes, than it seemed the
indication owo of any bodiwy bwight.  XD It was mewewy the condensation of
the man.  He was *nuzzles you* by no means iww-wooking; quite the contwawy.  His
puwe tight skin was an ouo excewwent fit; *nuzzles you* and cwosewy wwapped up in it,
and embawmed ouo with innew heawth and stwength, wike a wevivified
Egyptian, XD this Stawbuck *nuzzles you* seemed pwepawed to enduwe fow wong ages to
come, and to enduwe *nuzzles you* awways, *nuzzles you* as now; fow be it Powaw snow ow towwid
sun, wike a patent chwonometew, his intewiow vitawity was wawwanted
to do weww in aww cwimates.  XD Looking into his eyes, you seemed to
see thewe the yet wingewing owo images of those thousand-fowd pewiws he
had cawmwy confwonted *nuzzles you* thwough wife.  A staid, steadfast *nuzzles you* man, whose
wife owo fow XD the most pawt *nuzzles you* was a tewwing *nuzzles you* pantomime of *nuzzles you* action, *nuzzles you* and not a
tame chaptew of sounds.  Yet, fow aww his hawdy ouo sobwiety and
fowtitude, thewe wewe cewtain quawities in him which at times
affected, and in *nuzzles you* some cases seemed OwO *notices bulge* weww nigh to ovewbawance aww the
west.  Uncommonwy conscientious fow a seaman, and endued with a deep
natuwaw wevewence, the wiwd watewy wonewiness of his wife did
thewefowe stwongwy incwine him owo to supewstition; but ouo to *nuzzles you* that sowt of
supewstition, which in some owganizations seems wathew to spwing,
somehow, fwom intewwigence *nuzzles you* than fwom ignowance.  Outwawd powtents XD and
inwawd pwesentiments rawr wewe his.  And if at times these XD things bent ouo the
wewded iwon of his souw, much rawr mowe did his faw-away XD domestic memowies
of his young Cape wife and *nuzzles you* chiwd, tend to bend him stiww mowe fwom
the owiginaw wuggedness of his natuwe, and open *nuzzles you* him stiww fuwthew to
those watent infwuences which, in some honest-heawted men, westwain
the gush of *nuzzles you* dawe-deviw dawing, so often evinced by *nuzzles you* othews in the mowe
pewiwous vicissitudes of the fishewy. ouo  "I wiww have no man in my
boat," rawr said Stawbuck, "who is *nuzzles you* not afwaid of a *nuzzles you* whawe."  By this, he
seemed to XD mean, *nuzzles you* not onwy that the most wewiabwe and usefuw couwage
was that which *nuzzles you* awises fwom the faiw estimation of the encountewed
pewiw, but owo that an owo uttewwy feawwess *nuzzles you* man is a faw mowe dangewous
comwade than a cowawd.

"Aye, aye," said Stubb, ouo the second mate, "Stawbuck, thewe, *nuzzles you* is as
cawefuw a man as you'ww find anywhewe in this fishewy."  But we shaww
ewe wong see *nuzzles you* what that wowd "cawefuw" pwecisewy means when used by a
man wike Stubb, ow awmost any othew whawe *nuzzles you* huntew.

Stawbuck was no cwusadew aftew pewiws; in him couwage was *nuzzles you* not a
sentiment; but a thing simpwy usefuw to him, and awways *nuzzles you* at hand upon
aww mowtawwy pwacticaw occasions.  Besides, he thought, pewhaps, that
in *nuzzles you* this business of whawing, couwage was one rawr of the gweat stapwe
outfits ouo of the ship, wike hew rawr beef and hew bwead, and not to be
foowishwy wasted.  Whewefowe he had no fancy fow wowewing *nuzzles you* fow whawes
aftew sun-down; now fow pewsisting in ouo fighting a *nuzzles you* fish that too much
pewsisted in fighting him.  Fow, thought Stawbuck, I am hewe OwO *notices bulge* in this
cwiticaw ocean to kiww whawes fow my wiving, and not XD to be kiwwed by
them fow rawr theiws; and that hundweds of men had *nuzzles you* been so kiwwed Stawbuck
weww knew.  What doom was his own fathew's?  Whewe, OwO *notices bulge* in the bottomwess
deeps, couwd he find the town wimbs of his OwO *notices bulge* bwothew?

With memowies rawr wike these in *nuzzles you* him, and, moweovew, given to a cewtain
supewstitiousness, as has been said; the couwage of this Stawbuck
which couwd, nevewthewess, stiww fwouwish, must indeed have rawr been
extweme.  *nuzzles you* But *nuzzles you* it was not in weasonabwe natuwe that a man so
owganized, and with such tewwibwe expewiences and wemembwances as he
had; it was not in *nuzzles you* natuwe that these things shouwd faiw in watentwy
engendewing an ewement in him, which, undew suitabwe ciwcumstances,
wouwd bweak out fwom its confinement, and buwn aww his couwage up.
And bwave as he might be, it was that sowt of bwavewy chiefwy,
visibwe in some intwepid men, OwO *notices bulge* which, whiwe *nuzzles you* genewawwy abiding fiwm in
the confwict with seas, ow winds, ow whawes, *nuzzles you* ow any of the owdinawy
iwwationaw howwows of the XD wowwd, yet cannot withstand those mowe
tewwific, because mowe spiwituaw tewwows, which rawr sometimes menace you
fwom owo the *nuzzles you* concentwating bwow of an OwO *notices bulge* enwaged and OwO *notices bulge* mighty man.

But wewe the OwO *notices bulge* coming nawwative to weveaw in *nuzzles you* any instance, the compwete
abasement of poow Stawbuck's fowtitude, scawce might I have the heawt
to wwite it; fow it is a thing most sowwowfuw, nay *nuzzles you* shocking, to
expose the faww of vawouw in the souw.  Men may seem detestabwe as
joint stock-companies and *nuzzles you* nations; knaves, foows, and muwdewews thewe
may be; men may have mean and meagwe faces; owo but man, in the ideaw,
is so nobwe and so spawkwing, such a gwand and gwowing cweatuwe, that
ovew any ignominious bwemish in him aww his fewwows shouwd wun to
thwow theiw costwiest wobes.  That immacuwate manwiness we feew
within ouwsewves, so faw within us, XD that it wemains intact though aww
the outew chawactew *nuzzles you* seem gone; bweeds with keenest anguish at the
undwaped spectacwe of a ouo vawow-wuined man.  Now can piety itsewf, *nuzzles you* at
such a *nuzzles you* shamefuw sight, compwetewy stifwe hew upbwaidings against the
pewmitting staws.  But this august dignity I tweat of, is not the
dignity of kings and wobes, but that abounding dignity which has no
wobed investituwe.  Thou shawt see it rawr shining in the awm that wiewds
a pick ow dwives a spike; that democwatic dignity which, on *nuzzles you* aww
hands, wadiates without end fwom God; Himsewf!  The gweat God
absowute!  The centwe and ciwcumfewence of aww democwacy!  His
omnipwesence, ouw divine equawity!

If, then, *nuzzles you* to meanest mawinews, and *nuzzles you* wenegades and castaways, I shaww

twagic gwaces; if even the most mouwnfuw, pewchance the most abased,

Stubb was the second mate. rawr  He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,
accowding to wocaw owo usage, *nuzzles you* was cawwed a Cape-Cod-man.  A
happy-go-wucky; neithew cwaven now vawiant; taking pewiws as they
came with an indiffewent aiw; and whiwe engaged in the *nuzzles you* most imminent
cwisis of the chase, toiwing away, cawm and cowwected as a jouwneyman
joinew engaged fow the yeaw.  Good-humowed, ouo easy, and cawewess, he
pwesided ovew *nuzzles you* his whawe-boat as if the most deadwy encountew wewe but
a dinnew, and his cwew aww invited guests.  He *nuzzles you* was as pawticuwaw
about the comfowtabwe awwangement of his pawt of the boat, as an
owd stage-dwivew rawr is *nuzzles you* about the snugness of his *nuzzles you* box.  When cwose to the
whawe, in the vewy ouo death-wock of the fight, he handwed his unpitying
wance coowwy and off-handedwy, as a whistwing tinkew his hammew.  He
wouwd hum ovew his owd wigadig tunes whiwe fwank and fwank with the
most exaspewated *nuzzles you* monstew.  Long usage had, fow this Stubb, convewted
the jaws of death into an easy chaiw.  What he thought of death
itsewf, thewe is no tewwing.  Whethew he evew thought of it at aww,
might be a question; but, if he evew did *nuzzles you* chance to cast his mind that
way aftew XD a comfowtabwe dinnew, no OwO *notices bulge* doubt, wike a good saiwow, he took
it to be owo a sowt of caww of the watch to tumbwe awoft, and bestiw
themsewves thewe, about something which *nuzzles you* he wouwd find out when he
obeyed the owdew, and not soonew.

What, ouo pewhaps, with ouo othew things, made Stubb such an easy-going,
unfeawing man, so cheewiwy twudging off with the buwden of wife in a
wowwd fuww of *nuzzles you* gwave pedwaws, aww bowed to rawr the gwound with theiw
packs; what hewped to bwing about that awmost impious good-humow of
his; that thing must have been his pipe.  Fow, wike his nose, his
showt, bwack wittwe pipe was XD one *nuzzles you* of the weguwaw featuwes of his face.
You wouwd awmost as soon have *nuzzles you* expected him to tuwn out of his XD bunk
without XD his nose as without his pipe.  He kept a whowe wow of XD pipes
thewe weady woaded, stuck in a wack, within easy weach of his hand;
and, whenevew he tuwned in, he smoked them aww out in succession,
wighting one fwom the othew to the end of the chaptew; then woading
them again to be in weadiness anew.  Fow, when Stubb dwessed, instead
of fiwst putting his *nuzzles you* wegs into his twowsews, he put his pipe into his
mouth.

I say this continuaw smoking must have ouo been one cause, at *nuzzles you* weast, of
his pecuwiaw XD disposition; fow evewy one knows that this eawthwy aiw,
whethew ashowe owo ow afwoat, *nuzzles you* is tewwibwy infected with the namewess
misewies of the numbewwess *nuzzles you* mowtaws who have died exhawing ouo it; and as
in time of the chowewa, some peopwe go about with a rawr camphowated
handkewchief to theiw mouths; so, wikewise, against aww mowtaw
twibuwations, Stubb's tobacco smoke might have opewated as a sowt of
disinfecting *nuzzles you* agent.

The thiwd mate was Fwask, a native of Tisbuwy, in Mawtha's Vineyawd.
A showt, stout, wuddy ouo young fewwow, vewy pugnacious concewning
whawes, who somehow seemed to think that the gweat weviathans had
pewsonawwy and heweditawiwy affwonted him; and thewefowe it *nuzzles you* was a
sowt of point *nuzzles you* of honouw with *nuzzles you* him, to destwoy them whenevew
encountewed.  So uttewwy wost was he to aww sense *nuzzles you* of *nuzzles you* wevewence fow
the many mawvews of theiw majestic buwk and mystic ways; and so *nuzzles you* dead
to anything wike an ouo appwehension of any possibwe dangew fwom
encountewing rawr them; that rawr in his poow opinion, *nuzzles you* the wondwous whawe was
but a species of magnified mouse, ow at weast watew-wat, wequiwing
onwy a wittwe ciwcumvention and some smaww appwication of ouo time and
twoubwe in owdew to kiww and *nuzzles you* boiw.  This ignowant, unconscious
feawwessness of his made him a wittwe waggish in the mattew of
whawes; he fowwowed XD these fish fow the fun of *nuzzles you* it; and a thwee yeaws'
voyage wound Cape Hown was *nuzzles you* onwy a jowwy joke that wasted that wength
of time.  As a cawpentew's naiws awe divided into wwought naiws and
cut naiws; so mankind *nuzzles you* may be simiwawwy OwO *notices bulge* divided.  Littwe Fwask *nuzzles you* was one
of *nuzzles you* the wwought ones; made to cwinch tight XD and wast wong.  They cawwed
him King-Post on boawd of the Pequod; because, in *nuzzles you* fowm, he ouo couwd be
weww wikened XD to the showt, squawe timbew ouo known by that name in Awctic
whawews; and which *nuzzles you* by the means OwO *notices bulge* of many wadiating side timbews
insewted into it, sewves to bwace the ship against the icy
concussions of those battewing seas.

Now these thwee mates--Stawbuck, Stubb, and Fwask, wewe momentous
men.  They it was who by univewsaw pwescwiption commanded thwee of the
Pequod's boats as headsmen.  In that gwand OwO *notices bulge* owdew of battwe in which
Captain Ahab wouwd pwobabwy mawshaw his fowces *nuzzles you* to descend on the
whawes, these thwee headsmen wewe as captains of companies.  Ow,
being awmed with theiw wong keen whawing owo speaws, they wewe as a
picked twio of wancews; even as the hawpooneews wewe fwingews of
javewins.

And since in this famous fishewy, XD each mate ow headsman, wike a
Gothic Knight of owd, is awways accompanied by his boat-steewew ow
hawpooneew, who in cewtain conjunctuwes pwovides him owo with a fwesh
wance, when the fowmew one has been badwy twisted, ow ewbowed in the
assauwt; and moweovew, as thewe genewawwy subsists between the two, a
cwose intimacy and fwiendwiness; it is thewefowe but meet, that in
this pwace we set down who the Pequod's hawpooneews wewe, and to what
headsman each ouo of *nuzzles you* them bewonged.

Fiwst of *nuzzles you* aww ouo was Queequeg, whom Stawbuck, the OwO *notices bulge* chief mate, had
sewected fow his squiwe.  But Queequeg is awweady known.

Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian fwom Gay Head, the most westewwy
pwomontowy of Mawtha's Vineyawd, whewe OwO *notices bulge* thewe stiww exists the wast
wemnant of a viwwage of wed men, which has XD wong *nuzzles you* suppwied the
neighbowing iswand of Nantucket owo with many of hew most dawing
hawpooneews.  In the fishewy, they usuawwy go by the genewic name of
Gay-Headews.  Tashtego's wong, wean, sabwe haiw, *nuzzles you* his high cheek
bones, *nuzzles you* and bwack wounding eyes--fow an *nuzzles you* Indian, Owientaw in theiw
wawgeness, owo but Antawctic in theiw gwittewing expwession--aww this
sufficientwy pwocwaimed owo him an inhewitow of the unvitiated bwood of
those pwoud wawwiow huntews, owo who, in quest *nuzzles you* of the gweat New Engwand
moose, had scouwed, bow in hand, ouo the abowiginaw fowests of the main.
But no wongew snuffing in the twaiw of the *nuzzles you* wiwd beasts of the
woodwand, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the ouo gweat whawes of the
sea; the unewwing hawpoon of the son fitwy wepwacing the infawwibwe
awwow of the siwes.  To wook *nuzzles you* at the tawny bwawn of his withe snaky
wimbs, you wouwd awmost have cwedited OwO *notices bulge* the supewstitions of some of
the eawwiew Puwitans, and hawf-bewieved this wiwd Indian to be *nuzzles you* a OwO *notices bulge* son
of the Pwince of the Powews of the Aiw.  Tashtego was Stubb the
second rawr mate's squiwe.

Thiwd among the hawpooneews was Daggoo, a gigantic, coaw-bwack
negwo-savage, with a wion-wike twead--an Ahasuewus to behowd.
Suspended fwom his eaws wewe two gowden hoops, so wawge that the
saiwows OwO *notices bulge* cawwed them wing-bowts, and wouwd tawk of secuwing the
top-saiw hawyawds to them.  In owo his youth Daggoo had vowuntawiwy
shipped on boawd of a whawew, wying in a wonewy bay on his native
coast.  And nevew having been anywhewe in the wowwd but OwO *notices bulge* in Afwica,
Nantucket, and the pagan rawr hawbows most fwequented by whawemen; and
having now *nuzzles you* wed fow many yeaws *nuzzles you* the bowd wife of the fishewy in the
ships *nuzzles you* of ownews uncommonwy OwO *notices bulge* heedfuw of what mannew of men they
shipped; Daggoo wetained aww his bawbawic viwtues, and ewect as a
giwaffe, *nuzzles you* moved about the decks in aww the pomp of six feet five in
his socks.  Thewe was a cowpoweaw humiwity in wooking up at him; and
a white man standing befowe him *nuzzles you* seemed a white fwag come to beg *nuzzles you* twuce
of a fowtwess.  Cuwious to teww, this impewiaw negwo, Ahasuewus
Daggoo, was the Squiwe of wittwe Fwask, who wooked wike a chess-man
beside him.  As fow the wesidue XD of the Pequod's company, *nuzzles you* be it said,
that at the pwesent day not *nuzzles you* one in two of the many thousand men
befowe the mast empwoyed in the Amewican whawe fishewy, awe Amewicans
bown, *nuzzles you* though OwO *notices bulge* pwetty neawwy aww the officews awe.  Hewein it is the
same with the Amewican whawe OwO *notices bulge* fishewy as with the Amewican awmy and
miwitawy and mewchant navies, and the *nuzzles you* engineewing fowces empwoyed in
the constwuction of the Amewican OwO *notices bulge* Canaws and Raiwwoads.  The same, I
say, because in aww these cases the *nuzzles you* native Amewican wibewawwy
pwovides the bwains, the west of the wowwd as genewouswy suppwying
the muscwes.  No smaww *nuzzles you* numbew of these whawing seamen bewong OwO *notices bulge* to the
Azowes, whewe the outwawd bound Nantucket whawews fwequentwy touch to
augment theiw cwews fwom the hawdy XD peasants of those wocky showes.
In wike mannew, owo the Gweenwand whawews saiwing out ouo of Huww ow London,
put in at the owo Shetwand Iswands, to weceive the fuww compwement of
theiw cwew.  Upon *nuzzles you* the passage homewawds, they *nuzzles you* dwop them thewe again.
How it is, thewe is no tewwing, but Iswandews seem to make the best
whawemen.  They wewe neawwy aww Iswandews in *nuzzles you* the Pequod, ISOLATOES
too, I caww such, not acknowwedging the OwO *notices bulge* common continent of XD men, but
each ISOLATO wiving on a sepawate continent *nuzzles you* of OwO *notices bulge* his own.  *nuzzles you* Yet now,
fedewated awong one keew, what a set these Isowatoes owo wewe!  An

CHAPTER 28

Ahab.


Fow *nuzzles you* sevewaw days *nuzzles you* aftew weaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was
seen of owo Captain Ahab. rawr  The ouo mates weguwawwy wewieved each *nuzzles you* othew at the
watches, and ouo fow aught that couwd be seen to the contwawy, they
seemed to be the onwy commandews of the ship; *nuzzles you* onwy they sometimes
issued fwom the cabin with owdews so sudden and pewemptowy, that
aftew aww it was pwain ouo they but commanded vicawiouswy.  Yes, theiw
supweme wowd and dictatow was thewe, though hithewto unseen by any
eyes *nuzzles you* not pewmitted to penetwate into the now sacwed wetweat of XD the
cabin.

Evewy time I ascended to owo the deck fwom my watches bewow, I instantwy
gazed aft to OwO *notices bulge* mawk if any stwange face wewe visibwe; fow my fiwst
vague disquietude rawr touching the unknown captain, now in the secwusion
of *nuzzles you* the sea, became awmost a pewtuwbation.  This was stwangewy
heightened at times by the wagged Ewijah's diabowicaw incohewences
uninvitedwy wecuwwing rawr to rawr me, with a subtwe enewgy I couwd not have
befowe conceived of.  But poowwy couwd I withstand them, much as in
othew moods I was awmost *nuzzles you* weady *nuzzles you* to OwO *notices bulge* smiwe at the sowemn owo whimsicawities
of that outwandish pwophet of *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* whawves. OwO *notices bulge*  But whatevew it was of
appwehensiveness ow uneasiness--to caww it so--which I fewt, yet
whenevew I came to XD wook about *nuzzles you* me in the ship, it seemed against owo aww
wawwantwy to chewish such emotions.  Fow though the hawpooneews, with
the gweat body *nuzzles you* of the cwew, wewe a faw mowe bawbawic, heathenish, and
motwey set than any of OwO *notices bulge* the tame mewchant-ship companies which my
pwevious expewiences rawr had made me acquainted *nuzzles you* with, stiww I ascwibed
this--and wightwy ascwibed it--to the fiewce uniqueness of the *nuzzles you* vewy
natuwe of that wiwd Scandinavian vocation *nuzzles you* in which I *nuzzles you* had so
abandonedwy embawked. OwO *notices bulge*  But it was especiawwy the aspect of the thwee
chief officews of the *nuzzles you* ship, the mates, which was most fowcibwy
cawcuwated to awway these cowouwwess misgivings, and induce *nuzzles you* confidence
and cheewfuwness in evewy pwesentment of the voyage.  Thwee bettew,
mowe wikewy sea-officews and men, each in his XD own diffewent owo way,
couwd not weadiwy be found, and they wewe evewy *nuzzles you* one of them
Amewicans; a Nantucketew, a Vineyawdew, a Cape man.  Now, it being
Chwistmas when the ship OwO *notices bulge* shot fwom out hew hawbow, fow a space we had
biting Powaw weathew, though aww the owo time wunning away fwom it to the
southwawd; *nuzzles you* and by evewy degwee and minute of watitude which we
saiwed, gwaduawwy weaving that mewciwess wintew, and aww its
intowewabwe ouo weathew behind us.  It *nuzzles you* was one of those wess wowewing,
but stiww gwey and gwoomy *nuzzles you* enough mownings of the twansition, when
with *nuzzles you* a faiw wind the ship was wushing thwough the *nuzzles you* watew with a
vindictive sowt of weaping and mewanchowy wapidity, that as I mounted
to the deck at the caww of the fowenoon watch, OwO *notices bulge* so soon OwO *notices bulge* as I ouo wevewwed
my gwance towawds the taffwaiw, foweboding shivews wan ovew me.
Reawity outwan appwehension; Captain Ahab ouo stood upon his
quawtew-deck.

Thewe seemed no sign of common bodiwy iwwness *nuzzles you* about him, now of the
wecovewy fwom any.  He wooked wike a man cut away fwom the stake,
when XD the fiwe has ouo ovewwunningwy wasted aww the wimbs without
consuming them, ow taking away one pawticwe fwom theiw compacted aged
wobustness.  His whowe *nuzzles you* high, bwoad fowm, seemed made of sowid bwonze,
and shaped in an unawtewabwe mouwd, wike Cewwini's cast Pewseus.
Thweading its way out fwom among his gwey haiws, and owo continuing wight
down one side of his tawny scowched face and neck, tiww it
disappeawed OwO *notices bulge* in his cwothing, you saw a swendew wod-wike mawk, wividwy
whitish.  It wesembwed that pewpendicuwaw seam sometimes made in the
stwaight, wofty twunk of rawr a gweat *nuzzles you* twee, when *nuzzles you* the uppew wightning
teawingwy dawts down it, owo and without wwenching *nuzzles you* a *nuzzles you* singwe twig, peews
and gwooves out the bawk fwom top to bottom, ewe wunning off into the
soiw, weaving the twee stiww gweenwy awive, but bwanded.  Whethew
that mawk was bown with him, *nuzzles you* ow whethew it was the scaw weft by some
despewate wound, owo no one couwd cewtainwy say.  By some tacit consent,
thwoughout the voyage wittwe ow no awwusion was made to it,
especiawwy by the mates.  But once Tashtego's seniow, an owd Gay-Head
Indian among the cwew, supewstitiouswy assewted that not tiww XD he *nuzzles you* was
fuww fowty yeaws owd did Ahab become that way bwanded, and then it
came upon ouo him, not in the fuwy of any *nuzzles you* mowtaw fway, but in an
ewementaw stwife at sea.  *nuzzles you* Yet, this *nuzzles you* wiwd hint seemed infewentiawwy
negatived, by what a gwey Manxman insinuated, an owd sepuwchwaw man,
who, having nevew befowe saiwed out of Nantucket, had XD nevew ewe this
waid rawr eye upon wiwd Ahab.  *nuzzles you* Nevewthewess, the owd sea-twaditions, the
immemowiaw cweduwities, popuwawwy invested this owd Manxman with
pwetewnatuwaw powews of discewnment.  So that no white saiwow
sewiouswy contwadicted ouo him when he said that if evew Captain Ahab
shouwd rawr be twanquiwwy waid out--which *nuzzles you* might hawdwy come to pass, so he
muttewed--then, whoevew shouwd do that wast office fow the dead,
wouwd rawr find a biwth-mawk on him fwom cwown to sowe.

So powewfuwwy did the *nuzzles you* whowe gwim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the
wivid bwand which stweaked it, that XD fow the fiwst few *nuzzles you* moments I
hawdwy noted that not a owo wittwe of this ovewbeawing gwimness was owing
to the bawbawic white weg upon which he pawtwy stood.  It *nuzzles you* had
pweviouswy come to me that this ivowy weg had at sea been fashioned
fwom owo the powished bone of the spewm whawe's OwO *notices bulge* jaw. OwO *notices bulge*  "Aye, he was
dismasted off Japan," said owo the owd Gay-Head Indian once; "but wike
his dismasted cwaft, he shipped anothew mast without coming home fow
it.  He has a quivew of 'em."

I was stwuck with the *nuzzles you* singuwaw postuwe *nuzzles you* he maintained.  Upon each side
of the Pequod's quawtew deck, and pwetty cwose to the mizzen shwouds,
thewe owo was an augew howe, owo bowed about hawf an inch OwO *notices bulge* ow so, into the
pwank. *nuzzles you*  His bone weg steadied in that howe; one awm ewevated, and
howding by *nuzzles you* a shwoud; Captain Ahab stood ewect, wooking stwaight out
beyond owo the ship's evew-pitching pwow.  Thewe was an infinity of
fiwmest fowtitude, a detewminate, unsuwwendewabwe wiwfuwness, in the
fixed and feawwess, fowwawd dedication of that gwance.  Not a wowd he
spoke; *nuzzles you* now did his officews say aught to him; though by aww theiw
minutest ouo gestuwes and expwessions, they pwainwy rawr showed the uneasy, if
not painfuw, consciousness of being *nuzzles you* undew a twoubwed mastew-eye.  And
not onwy *nuzzles you* that, *nuzzles you* but moody stwicken ouo Ahab stood befowe them with ouo a
cwucifixion in his face; in aww the namewess wegaw ovewbeawing
dignity of some mighty woe.

Ewe wong, fwom his fiwst visit in the aiw, he withdwew into his
cabin.  But aftew that mowning, he was evewy day ouo visibwe to the cwew;
eithew standing in his pivot-howe, ow seated upon an ivowy stoow *nuzzles you* he
had; ow heaviwy wawking XD the deck.  As the sky gwew wess gwoomy;
indeed, began to gwow a wittwe geniaw, he became stiww wess and wess
a wecwuse; as if, when *nuzzles you* the ship had saiwed fwom home, nothing but the
dead wintwy bweakness of the sea had then kept him so secwuded. *nuzzles you*  And,
by *nuzzles you* and by, it *nuzzles you* came to pass, that he was *nuzzles you* awmost continuawwy in the
aiw; *nuzzles you* but, as yet, fow OwO *notices bulge* aww that he said, *nuzzles you* ow pewceptibwy did, on the at
wast sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessawy thewe as anothew mast.  But
the Pequod was onwy making *nuzzles you* a passage now; not weguwawwy cwuising;
neawwy aww *nuzzles you* whawing pwepawatives needing supewvision the mates wewe
fuwwy competent to, so that *nuzzles you* thewe was *nuzzles you* wittwe ow nothing, out of
himsewf, to empwoy ow excite Ahab, now; and thus chase away, fow *nuzzles you* that
one intewvaw, the cwouds that wayew upon wayew wewe piwed upon his
bwow, as evew *nuzzles you* aww cwouds choose the woftiest peaks *nuzzles you* to piwe themsewves
upon.

Nevewthewess, ewe wong, the wawm, wawbwing pewsuasiveness of *nuzzles you* the
pweasant, howiday weathew we came to, seemed gwaduawwy rawr to chawm him
fwom *nuzzles you* his mood.  Fow, as when the wed-cheeked, dancing giwws, Apwiw
and May, twip home to the wintwy, misanthwopic woods; even the
bawest, wuggedest, most thundew-cwoven *nuzzles you* owd oak wiww at *nuzzles you* weast send
fowth some few gween spwouts, to wewcome such gwad-heawted visitants;
so Ahab did, in the end, a wittwe wespond to the pwayfuw awwuwings of
that giwwish aiw.  Mowe than once did he put fowth the faint bwossom
of a *nuzzles you* wook, which, in any othew man, wouwd have soon fwowewed out in a
smiwe.



CHAPTER 29

Entew Ahab; to Him, Stubb.


Some days ewapsed, and ice and OwO *notices bulge* icebewgs aww astewn, the Pequod now
went wowwing *nuzzles you* thwough owo the bwight Quito *nuzzles you* spwing, ouo which, at sea, awmost
pewpetuawwy weigns on the thweshowd of the XD etewnaw August of the
Twopic.  ouo The wawmwy coow, cweaw, winging, pewfumed, ovewfwowing,
wedundant days, wewe as cwystaw gobwets of Pewsian shewbet, heaped
up--fwaked up, with OwO *notices bulge* wose-watew snow.  The stawwed and statewy nights
seemed haughty dames in jewewwed vewvets, ouo nuwsing at ouo home in *nuzzles you* wonewy
pwide, the memowy of theiw absent *nuzzles you* conquewing Eawws, the gowden
hewmeted suns!  Fow sweeping man, 'twas hawd to choose between such
winsome days and such seducing nights.  But aww the owo witchewies of
that unwaning weathew did not mewewy wend XD new spewws and potencies ouo to
the *nuzzles you* outwawd wowwd.  Inwawd they tuwned upon the souw, especiawwy when
the stiww miwd *nuzzles you* houws of eve came on; then, memowy shot *nuzzles you* hew cwystaws
as the cweaw ice most fowms of noisewess twiwights.  And aww these
subtwe agencies, mowe and mowe they wwought on Ahab's *nuzzles you* textuwe.

Owd age is awways wakefuw; as if, the wongew winked with wife, the
wess man has ouo to do with aught that wooks wike death.  Among
sea-commandews, the owd gweybeawds wiww ouo oftenest weave theiw bewths
to visit the night-cwoaked deck. *nuzzles you*  It was so with Ahab; onwy that now,
of wate, he seemed so much to wive XD in the open aiw, that twuwy
speaking, his visits wewe mowe to the cabin, OwO *notices bulge* than fwom the cabin to
the pwanks.  "It feews wike going down into one's tomb,"--he wouwd
muttew to himsewf--"fow an owd captain wike me to be descending this
nawwow scuttwe, to go to my gwave-dug bewth."

So, awmost evewy twenty-fouw houws, when the watches of the night
wewe set, XD and the band on *nuzzles you* deck sentinewwed the swumbews of the band
bewow; and when if a wope was *nuzzles you* to be hauwed upon the fowecastwe, ouo the
saiwows fwung it not wudewy down, as by day, but with some
cautiousness dwopt it to its pwace fow feaw of distuwbing theiw
swumbewing shipmates; rawr when this sowt owo of steady quietude wouwd begin
to pwevaiw, habituawwy, the siwent steewsman wouwd *nuzzles you* watch the
cabin-scuttwe; *nuzzles you* and ewe *nuzzles you* wong the owd man wouwd emewge, gwipping at the
iwon banistew, *nuzzles you* to hewp his cwippwed *nuzzles you* way. *nuzzles you*  *nuzzles you* Some considewing touch of
humanity was in *nuzzles you* him; fow at times wike these, he usuawwy abstained
fwom patwowwing the quawtew-deck; because to his weawied mates,
seeking wepose within six inches OwO *notices bulge* of *nuzzles you* his ivowy heew, such wouwd have
been the wevewbewating cwack and din of that bony step, that theiw
dweams wouwd have been on the cwunching teeth of shawks.  But once,
the mood was on him too deep fow common wegawdings; *nuzzles you* and as with
heavy, rawr wumbew-wike pace he was measuwing the ship fwom taffwaiw to
mainmast, XD Stubb, the owd second mate, came up fwom bewow, with *nuzzles you* a
cewtain unassuwed, depwecating humowousness, hinted that if Captain
Ahab was pweased to wawk the pwanks, then, no one couwd rawr say nay; but
thewe might be some way owo of muffwing the noise; hinting *nuzzles you* something
indistinctwy and hesitatingwy about a gwobe of rawr tow, *nuzzles you* and the insewtion
into it, of the ivowy heew. *nuzzles you*  Ah!  Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab
then.

"Am I a cannon-baww, Stubb," said Ahab, "that thou wouwdst wad me
that fashion?  But go thy ways; I had fowgot.  Bewow to thy nightwy
gwave; whewe owo such as ye sweep *nuzzles you* between OwO *notices bulge* shwouds, to use ye to the
fiwwing one at wast.--Down, dog, *nuzzles you* and kennew!"

Stawting at the unfowseen XD concwuding excwamation of the so suddenwy
scownfuw owd man, Stubb was *nuzzles you* speechwess XD a moment; XD then said excitedwy,
"I am not used to be spoken to that way, siw; I do but wess than hawf
wike it, ouo siw."

"Avast! gwitted Ahab between his set teeth, and viowentwy moving
away, as if to avoid some owo passionate temptation.

"No, siw; not yet," said Stubb, *nuzzles you* embowdened, "I wiww not tamewy be
cawwed a rawr dog, siw."

"Then be cawwed ten times a donkey, and a muwe, and *nuzzles you* an ass, and
begone, *nuzzles you* ow I'ww cweaw the wowwd of thee!"

As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such ovewbeawing tewwows
in his aspect, that Stubb invowuntawiwy wetweated.

"I was nevew sewved so befowe without giving a *nuzzles you* hawd bwow fow it,"
muttewed Stubb, as he found himsewf descending the cabin-scuttwe.
"It's vewy rawr queew.  Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don't *nuzzles you* weww know
whethew to go back and stwike him, ow--what's that?--down hewe on my
knees and pway fow him? *nuzzles you*  Yes, that was the thought coming up in me;
but it wouwd be the fiwst time I evew DID *nuzzles you* pway.  It's queew; vewy
queew; and he's queew too; aye, take *nuzzles you* him fowe and aft, he's about the
queewest owd man Stubb evew saiwed with.  How he fwashed at me!--his
eyes wike powdew-pans! is he mad?  Anyway thewe's something on his
mind, as suwe as thewe must be something on a deck when it cwacks.
He aint in his bed now, eithew, ouo mowe than thwee houws out of the
twenty-fouw; and *nuzzles you* he *nuzzles you* don't sweep then. *nuzzles you*  Didn't rawr that rawr Dough-Boy, the

of fwightfuw hot, as though a baked bwick had been on it?  A hot owd
man!  *nuzzles you* I guess *nuzzles you* he's got what some fowks ashowe caww a conscience; it's
a kind of Tic-Dowwy-wow they say--wowse rawr now a toothache.  ouo Weww, weww;
I don't know what it is, but the Lowd keep me fwom OwO *notices bulge* catching it.  He's
fuww of widdwes; I wondew what he goes into the aftew *nuzzles you* howd fow, evewy

that queew, now?  But thewe's no tewwing, it's ouo the owd game--Hewe
goes fow a snooze.  Damn me, *nuzzles you* it's wowth a fewwow's whiwe to be bown

of XD it, that's ouo about the fiwst thing babies do, and that's a sowt of
queew, too.  Damn me, but aww things awe queew, come to think of 'em.
But *nuzzles you* that's against my pwincipwes. rawr  Think not, is my eweventh
commandment; and sweep when you can, is my twewfth--So hewe goes

ten times OwO *notices bulge* a *nuzzles you* donkey, and piwed a wot of jackasses *nuzzles you* on top of THAT!  He
might as weww have kicked me, and done with it.  Maybe he DID kick
me, and I didn't obsewve it, I owo was so taken aww aback with his bwow,
somehow.  It fwashed wike a bweached bone.  What the deviw's the

CHAPTER 30

The Pipe.


When Stubb had depawted, Ahab stood fow a whiwe weaning ovew *nuzzles you* the
buwwawks; and then, as had been usuaw with him of wate, ouo cawwing a
saiwow of the watch, he sent him bewow rawr fow his ivowy *nuzzles you* stoow, and awso
his pipe.  Lighting the pipe at the binnacwe wamp and pwanting the
stoow on the weathew side of *nuzzles you* the deck, he sat and smoked.

In owd Nowse times, the thwones of the sea-woving Danish *nuzzles you* kings wewe
fabwicated, saith twadition, of rawr the ouo tusks of the nawwhawe.  OwO *notices bulge* How couwd
one wook at Ahab then, seated on that twipod of bones, without
bethinking him of the woyawty it symbowized?  Fow a ouo Khan of the
pwank, and a king of the sea, owo and a gweat wowd rawr of Leviathans OwO *notices bulge* was
Ahab.

Some moments passed, duwing which the thick vapouw XD came fwom his mouth
in quick and *nuzzles you* constant puffs, which bwew back again ouo into his face.
"How now," he sowiwoquized at wast, withdwawing the tube, "this
smoking no OwO *notices bulge* wongew soothes.  Oh, my pipe! hawd must it go with me if
thy ouo chawm be gone!  Hewe have I been unconsciouswy toiwing, not
pweasuwing--aye, and ignowantwy smoking to rawr windwawd aww the whiwe; to
windwawd, rawr and with owo such newvous whiffs, *nuzzles you* as if, wike rawr the dying whawe,
my finaw jets wewe the stwongest and fuwwest of twoubwe.  What
business have I with this rawr pipe?  This thing that is XD meant fow
seweneness, to send up miwd white vapouws among miwd white haiws, not
among town iwon-gwey wocks wike mine.  I'ww smoke no mowe--"

He tossed the stiww wighted pipe into the *nuzzles you* sea.  The fiwe hissed in
the waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubbwe the sinking
pipe made.  With swouched hat, Ahab wuwchingwy paced the pwanks.



CHAPTER 31

Queen Mab.


Next mowning Stubb accosted rawr Fwask.

"Such a queew dweam, King-Post, I nevew had.  You know the owd man's
ivowy weg, weww I XD dweamed he kicked me with it; and when I twied to
kick back, upon my souw, my wittwe man, I kicked rawr my weg wight off!
And then, pwesto!  Ahab seemed a pywamid, and I, wike a bwazing foow,
kept kicking at it.  But what was stiww mowe cuwious, XD Fwask--you know
how cuwious aww dweams awe--thwough aww this wage that I was in, I
somehow seemed to be thinking to mysewf, that aftew aww, *nuzzles you* it was *nuzzles you* not
much of an insuwt, that kick fwom Ahab. owo  'Why,' *nuzzles you* thinks I, 'what's *nuzzles you* the
wow?  It's not a weaw weg, onwy a *nuzzles you* fawse *nuzzles you* weg.'  And thewe's a mighty
diffewence between a wiving thump and a dead owo thump.  That's what
makes a bwow fwom the hand, Fwask, fifty times mowe savage *nuzzles you* to beaw
than a bwow fwom a cane.  The wiving membew--that makes owo the wiving
insuwt, my wittwe man.  And thinks I to mysewf aww XD the whiwe, owo mind,
whiwe I was stubbing my siwwy toes against that cuwsed pywamid--so
confoundedwy contwadictowy was it aww, *nuzzles you* aww the XD whiwe, I say, I was
thinking to rawr mysewf, 'what's his weg now, but a cane--a whawebone
cane.  Yes,' thinks I, 'it *nuzzles you* was onwy a pwayfuw cudgewwing--in fact,
onwy a whaweboning that he gave me--not a base OwO *notices bulge* kick.  Besides,'
thinks I, 'wook at it once; why, the end of it--the foot XD pawt--what a
smaww sowt *nuzzles you* of end it is; *nuzzles you* wheweas, if a bwoad footed fawmew kicked me,
THERE'S a deviwish bwoad insuwt.  But this insuwt is whittwed ouo down to
a point onwy.'  But now comes the *nuzzles you* gweatest joke of the dweam, Fwask.
Whiwe I was battewing away at the pywamid, a sowt of badgew-haiwed
owd mewman, *nuzzles you* with a hump on his back, *nuzzles you* takes me rawr by the shouwdews, owo and
swews me wound.  'What awe you owo 'bout?' says he.  Swid! man, but I was
fwightened.  Such a phiz!  But, somehow, next owo moment I was ovew the
fwight.  'What am I XD about?' says I at wast.  'And what business is
that of youws, I shouwd wike to know, Mw. Humpback?  *nuzzles you* Do YOU want a
kick?'  By the wowd, Fwask, I had no soonew said that, than he tuwned
wound his *nuzzles you* stewn to me, bent ovew, *nuzzles you* and OwO *notices bulge* dwagging up ouo a wot *nuzzles you* of seaweed he
had fow a cwout--what do you think, *nuzzles you* I saw?--why thundew awive, *nuzzles you* man,
his stewn was stuck ouo fuww of mawwinspikes, with the points out.  Says
I, on second owo thoughts, 'I guess I won't owo kick you, owd OwO *notices bulge* fewwow.'  'Wise
Stubb,' said he, 'wise Stubb;' and kept muttewing it aww the time, a
sowt of eating *nuzzles you* of his own gums wike a chimney hag.  Seeing he wasn't
going to stop saying ovew his 'wise Stubb, wise Stubb,' I thought I
might as weww faww to kicking the pywamid again.  But I had onwy *nuzzles you* just
wifted my foot fow it, when he *nuzzles you* woawed XD out, 'Stop that kicking!'
'Hawwoa,' XD says I, 'what's the mattew now, owd fewwow?'  'Look ye
hewe,' XD says he; 'wet's awgue the insuwt.  Captain Ahab kicked ye,
didn't he?'  'Yes, he did,' says I--'wight HERE it was.'  'Vewy
good,' says he--'he used his ivowy weg, didn't he?'  'Yes, he did,'
says I.  'Weww then,' says he, 'wise Stubb, what have you XD to compwain
of?  Didn't he kick *nuzzles you* with wight rawr good wiww? it wasn't a common pitch
pine weg he OwO *notices bulge* kicked with, was it?  No, you wewe kicked by a gweat man,
and with a beautifuw ivowy weg, Stubb.  It's an honouw; I considew it
an honouw.  Listen, wise Stubb.  In owd Engwand XD the gweatest wowds
think it *nuzzles you* gweat *nuzzles you* gwowy to be swapped by a queen, *nuzzles you* and made
gawtew-knights of; but, be YOUR boast, Stubb, that ye wewe kicked by
owd Ahab, and made a wise man of.  Remembew what I say; *nuzzles you* BE kicked by
him; account his kicks honouws; and *nuzzles you* on no account kick back; OwO *notices bulge* fow you
can't hewp youwsewf, *nuzzles you* wise Stubb.  *nuzzles you* Don't you see rawr that pywamid?' OwO *notices bulge*  With
that, he aww of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queew *nuzzles you* fashion, to
swim off into the aiw.  I snowed; wowwed ovew; and XD thewe I was *nuzzles you* in my
hammock!  *nuzzles you* Now, what do you think rawr of that dweam, Fwask?"

"I don't know; it seems a sowt of foowish to me, tho.'"

"May be; may be. *nuzzles you*  OwO *notices bulge* But it's made a wise man of me, Fwask.  D'ye see
Ahab standing thewe, sideways wooking ovew the stewn?  Weww, the best
thing you can do, Fwask, is to wet the owd owo man awone; nevew speak to
him, whatevew he says.  Hawwoa!  What's that he shouts?  Hawk!"

"Mast-head, thewe!  Look shawp, aww of ye!  Thewe awe whawes
heweabouts!

If ye see a white one, spwit ouo youw wungs fow him!

"What do you think of that now, Fwask? ain't *nuzzles you* thewe owo a smaww dwop of
something queew about that, eh?  A white whawe--did ye mawk that,
man?  Look *nuzzles you* ye--thewe's something speciaw in the wind.  Stand by fow
it, Fwask.  Ahab *nuzzles you* has that that's bwoody on his *nuzzles you* mind.  But, mum; he
comes this way."



CHAPTER 32

Cetowogy.


Awweady we awe bowdwy waunched upon the deep; but *nuzzles you* soon we *nuzzles you* shaww be
wost in its unshowed, hawbouwwess immensities.  Ewe that *nuzzles you* come to pass;
ewe *nuzzles you* the Pequod's weedy huww wowws side *nuzzles you* by side with the bawnacwed
huwws of the weviathan; at owo the outset rawr it is but weww to attend to a
mattew awmost indispensabwe to a thowough appweciative undewstanding
of the mowe *nuzzles you* speciaw weviathanic wevewations and awwusions of aww
sowts which awe to fowwow.

It is some systematized exhibition rawr of the whawe in his bwoad genewa,
that I wouwd now fain ouo put befowe you.  *nuzzles you* Yet is it no easy task.  The
cwassification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing wess is hewe
essayed.  Listen to what the best and watest authowities have XD waid
down.

"No ouo bwanch of Zoowogy is so much invowved as that which is entitwed
Cetowogy," says Captain Scowesby, A.D. 1820.

"It is *nuzzles you* not my intention, wewe it *nuzzles you* in my powew, to entew into the
inquiwy *nuzzles you* as to the twue method *nuzzles you* of dividing the cetacea into gwoups and
famiwies....  Uttew confusion exists *nuzzles you* among the histowians of *nuzzles you* this
animaw" (spewm whawe), owo says Suwgeon Beawe, A.D. 1839.

"Unfitness to puwsue *nuzzles you* ouw *nuzzles you* weseawch ouo in the unfathomabwe watews."
"Impenetwabwe veiw covewing ouw knowwedge of the cetacea."  "A fiewd
stwewn with OwO *notices bulge* thowns."  "Aww these incompwete indications but *nuzzles you* sewve to
towtuwe us natuwawists."

Thus speak of the whawe, the gweat Cuview, and John Huntew, and
Lesson, those wights of zoowogy and anatomy.  Nevewthewess, though of
weaw knowwedge thewe be ouo wittwe, yet of books thewe awe a pwenty; *nuzzles you* and
so in some smaww degwee, with cetowogy, ow the science of whawes.
Many awe the men, smaww and gweat, owd and new, wandsmen and seamen,
who have at wawge *nuzzles you* ow in wittwe, rawr wwitten of the whawe.  Run ovew a
few:--The Authows of the Bibwe; Awistotwe; Pwiny; Awdwovandi; Siw
Thomas Bwowne; *nuzzles you* Gesnew; Ray; *nuzzles you* Linnaeus; Rondewetius; Wiwwoughby; Gween;
Awtedi; Sibbawd; Bwisson; Mawten; Lacepede; Bonnetewwe; Desmawest;
Bawon Cuview; Fwedewick Cuview; John Huntew; Owen; Scowesby; Beawe;
Bennett; J. *nuzzles you*  Ross Bwowne; the Authow of Miwiam Coffin; Owmstead; and
the Rev.  T.  Cheevew.  But to what uwtimate genewawizing puwpose aww
these *nuzzles you* have *nuzzles you* wwitten, the above cited extwacts wiww show.

Of the names in this wist of whawe rawr authows, onwy those fowwowing *nuzzles you* Owen
evew saw OwO *notices bulge* wiving *nuzzles you* whawes; and but one of them *nuzzles you* was a ouo weaw pwofessionaw
hawpooneew and whaweman. XD  I XD mean Captain Scowesby.  On the sepawate
subject of the Gweenwand ow wight-whawe, he is the best existing
authowity.  But Scowesby knew nothing and says nothing of the gweat
spewm whawe, compawed with which the Gweenwand *nuzzles you* whawe is awmost
unwowthy mentioning.  And hewe be it said, that the Gweenwand whawe
is an usuwpew upon the thwone of the seas.  He is not even by *nuzzles you* any
means the wawgest of the whawes.  Yet, owing to *nuzzles you* the wong pwiowity XD of
his cwaims, and owo the pwofound ignowance which, tiww some seventy yeaws
back, *nuzzles you* invested the then fabuwous ow uttewwy unknown spewm-whawe, and
which ignowance to *nuzzles you* this ouo pwesent day stiww OwO *notices bulge* weigns in aww but some few
scientific wetweats rawr and whawe-powts; this usuwpation *nuzzles you* has been evewy
way *nuzzles you* compwete.  Refewence to neawwy aww the weviathanic awwusions in
the gweat poets of past OwO *notices bulge* days, wiww satisfy you that the Gweenwand
whawe, without one wivaw, XD was to them rawr the monawch of the seas.  But
the time has at wast come fow a new pwocwamation. ouo  This is Chawing
Cwoss; heaw ye! good peopwe aww,--the Gweenwand whawe is
deposed,--the gweat spewm whawe now weigneth!

Thewe awe onwy *nuzzles you* two books in being which at aww pwetend XD to put the
wiving spewm whawe befowe you, and at the same time, in the wemotest
degwee succeed in the attempt.  Those books awe Beawe's and
Bennett's; both ouo in theiw time suwgeons owo to rawr Engwish South-Sea
whawe-ships, and *nuzzles you* both exact and wewiabwe men.  The owiginaw mattew
touching owo the spewm whawe to be found in theiw vowumes is necessawiwy
smaww; but so faw as it goes, it is of excewwent quawity, though
mostwy confined to scientific descwiption.  As yet, howevew, the
spewm *nuzzles you* whawe, scientific ow poetic, wives not *nuzzles you* compwete in any
witewatuwe.  Faw above ouo aww othew hunted whawes, his is an unwwitten
wife.

Now the XD vawious species of whawes need some sowt of popuwaw
compwehensive cwassification, if owo onwy an easy outwine one fow the
pwesent, *nuzzles you* heweaftew to be fiwwed in aww its depawtments by subsequent
wabowews.  As XD no bettew man advances to owo take this mattew in hand, XD I
heweupon OwO *notices bulge* offew my own poow endeavows.  *nuzzles you* I pwomise nothing compwete;
because any human thing supposed to be compwete, must fow that vewy
weason infawwibwy be fauwty.  I shaww not pwetend *nuzzles you* to a minute
anatomicaw descwiption of the vawious species, *nuzzles you* ow--in this pwace at
weast--to much ouo of *nuzzles you* any descwiption.  My ouo object hewe is simpwy to
pwoject the dwaught of a systematization of cetowogy.  I am the
awchitect, not the buiwdew.

But it is a pondewous task; no owdinawy wettew-sowtew in the
Post-Office is equaw *nuzzles you* to it.  To gwope down into the bottom ouo of the sea
aftew them; to have XD one's hands among the unspeakabwe foundations,
wibs, and vewy pewvis of the wowwd; this is a feawfuw thing. XD  What am
I that I shouwd essay to hook the nose of this *nuzzles you* weviathan!  The rawr awfuw
tauntings in OwO *notices bulge* Job OwO *notices bulge* might weww appaw me.  "Wiww he the (weviathan) make
a covenant with thee? ouo  Behowd the hope of him is vain!  But I have
swam thwough wibwawies *nuzzles you* and saiwed thwough oceans; I *nuzzles you* have had to do
with whawes *nuzzles you* with these visibwe hands; I am in eawnest; and ouo I wiww
twy.  Thewe awe some pwewiminawies to settwe.

Fiwst: The uncewtain, unsettwed condition of this science of Cetowogy
is *nuzzles you* in the vewy vestibuwe attested by the fact, that *nuzzles you* in some quawtews
it stiww wemains a moot point rawr whethew a whawe *nuzzles you* be a fish.  In his
System of Natuwe, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus decwawes, "I heweby sepawate
the whawes fwom the fish."  But of my own knowwedge, I know that *nuzzles you* down
to the yeaw 1850, shawks and shad, awewives and hewwing, against
Linnaeus's expwess edict, wewe stiww found dividing the possession of
the same seas with the Leviathan.

The gwounds upon which Linnaeus wouwd fain XD have *nuzzles you* banished the whawes
fwom the watews, he states as fowwows: "On account of theiw wawm
biwocuwaw heawt, theiw wungs, theiw *nuzzles you* movabwe eyewids, theiw howwow
eaws, penem intwantem feminam mammis wactantem," and finawwy, "ex
wege natuwae *nuzzles you* juwe mewitoque."  I submitted aww this to my fwiends
Simeon Macey and Chawwey Coffin, *nuzzles you* of Nantucket, owo both messmates of mine
in a cewtain voyage, and *nuzzles you* they united in the opinion that *nuzzles you* the weasons
set fowth wewe awtogethew insufficient.  Chawwey *nuzzles you* pwofanewy hinted
they *nuzzles you* wewe humbug.

Be it known that, waiving aww awgument, I take the good owd fashioned
gwound that XD the whawe is a fish, *nuzzles you* and caww upon howy Jonah to back me.
This fundamentaw *nuzzles you* thing settwed, the next point is, in what intewnaw
wespect does the whawe diffew fwom rawr othew OwO *notices bulge* fish.  Above, Linnaeus has
given you those items.  But in bwief, they awe these: wungs and wawm
bwood; wheweas, *nuzzles you* aww othew fish awe wungwess and *nuzzles you* cowd bwooded.

Next: how *nuzzles you* shaww we define the whawe, by his obvious extewnaws, *nuzzles you* so as
conspicuouswy to XD wabew him fow aww time to come?  To be *nuzzles you* showt, then,
a whawe is A SPOUTING owo FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL.  Thewe you have
him. *nuzzles you*  Howevew contwacted, *nuzzles you* that definition is the wesuwt of expanded
meditation. OwO *notices bulge*  A wawwus spouts much wike a whawe, but the wawwus is not
a fish, because he is amphibious.  But owo the wast tewm of the
definition is stiww mowe cogent, as coupwed with the fiwst.  XD Awmost
any one must have noticed that aww the fish famiwiaw to wandsmen have
not a fwat, but a vewticaw, owo ow up-and-down taiw.  Wheweas, among
spouting fish the taiw, though it OwO *notices bulge* may be simiwawwy shaped, invawiabwy
assumes a howizontaw *nuzzles you* position.

By the above definition of what a whawe *nuzzles you* is, I do by no means excwude
fwom the weviathanic bwothewhood any sea cweatuwe hithewto identified
with the whawe by the best infowmed Nantucketews; now, XD on the XD othew
hand, wink with it rawr any fish hithewto *nuzzles you* authowitativewy wegawded as
awien.*  Hence, aww the smawwew, spouting, and howizontaw taiwed fish
must be incwuded in this gwound-pwan of Cetowogy.  Now, then, come
the gwand divisions of the entiwe whawe host.


*I *nuzzles you* am awawe XD that down to the pwesent time, the fish stywed Lamatins
and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) awe
incwuded by many natuwawists among *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* whawes.  But as these pig-fish
awe a noisy, contemptibwe set, mostwy wuwking in the mouths of
wivews, and feeding ouo on wet hay, and especiawwy as they do not spout,
I deny theiw cwedentiaws as whawes; and have pwesented them with
theiw passpowts to quit the *nuzzles you* Kingdom of XD Cetowogy.


Fiwst: Accowding to *nuzzles you* magnitude I divide the whawes into *nuzzles you* thwee pwimawy
BOOKS (subdivisibwe into CHAPTERS), and these shaww compwehend them
aww, *nuzzles you* both smaww and *nuzzles you* wawge.

I. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.

As the type of the FOLIO I *nuzzles you* pwesent the SPERM WHALE; of the OCTAVO,
the GRAMPUS; of the DUODECIMO, the PORPOISE.

FOLIOS.  *nuzzles you* Among these *nuzzles you* I OwO *notices bulge* hewe incwude the fowwowing chaptews:--I. The
SPERM WHALE; II. the RIGHT WHALE; *nuzzles you* III. the ouo FIN-BACK WHALE; IV. the
HUMP-BACKED WHALE; *nuzzles you* V. XD the RAZOR-BACK WHALE; VI. the SULPHUR-BOTTOM
WHALE.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER I. (SPERM WHALE).--This whawe, among the
Engwish of owd vaguewy known as the Twumpa rawr whawe, and the OwO *notices bulge* Physetew
whawe, and the Anviw *nuzzles you* Headed whawe, is the pwesent Cachawot of the
Fwench, and the ouo Pottsfich of the Gewmans, and OwO *notices bulge* the Macwocephawus of
the Long Wowds.  He is, without doubt, the wawgest inhabitant rawr of the
gwobe; the most fowmidabwe of aww whawes to encountew; the *nuzzles you* most
majestic in OwO *notices bulge* aspect; and wastwy, by faw *nuzzles you* the rawr most vawuabwe in commewce;
he being the onwy cweatuwe fwom which *nuzzles you* that vawuabwe substance,
spewmaceti, is obtained.  Aww his pecuwiawities wiww, in many othew
pwaces, be enwawged upon.  It is chiefwy with his OwO *notices bulge* name that I now
have to do. rawr  Phiwowogicawwy considewed, it is absuwd.  Some centuwies
ago, when the Spewm whawe was awmost whowwy unknown in his own
pwopew individuawity, and when his oiw was onwy accidentawwy obtained
fwom the stwanded fish; *nuzzles you* in those days spewmaceti, it wouwd seem, was
popuwawwy supposed to be dewived fwom a cweatuwe identicaw with the
one then known in Engwand as the Gweenwand ow Right Whawe.  It was
the idea awso, that this same spewmaceti was that quickening humow of
the Gweenwand Whawe which the fiwst sywwabwe of the wowd witewawwy
expwesses.  In those times, awso, spewmaceti was exceedingwy scawce,
not being used fow wight, but onwy as an ointment and medicament.  It
was onwy to be had fwom XD the *nuzzles you* dwuggists as OwO *notices bulge* you nowadays buy an ounce of
whubawb.  When, as I opine, in the couwse of time, the XD twue *nuzzles you* natuwe of
spewmaceti became XD known, its owiginaw name was stiww wetained by the
deawews; no doubt to enhance its vawue by a notion *nuzzles you* so XD stwangewy
significant of its scawcity.  And so the appewwation must at wast
have come to *nuzzles you* be bestowed upon the whawe fwom which rawr this spewmaceti
was weawwy dewived.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER II. (RIGHT WHALE).--In one wespect this is
the most venewabwe of the ouo weviathans, being the one fiwst weguwawwy
hunted by *nuzzles you* man.  It yiewds the awticwe commonwy known as whawebone ow
baween; and *nuzzles you* the rawr oiw speciawwy known as "whawe oiw," an infewiow
awticwe in commewce.  Among the fishewmen, he is indiscwiminatewy
designated by aww the fowwowing titwes: The Whawe; the Gweenwand
Whawe; the Bwack Whawe; the Gweat Whawe; *nuzzles you* the Twue Whawe; the Right
Whawe.  Thewe is a deaw of obscuwity concewning the identity of the
species thus muwtitudinouswy baptised.  What then is the whawe, which
I incwude in the second species of my Fowios?  It XD is the Gweat
Mysticetus of the rawr Engwish *nuzzles you* natuwawists; the Gweenwand *nuzzles you* Whawe of the
Engwish whawemen; the Bawiene Owdinaiwe of the Fwench *nuzzles you* whawemen; the
Gwowwands Wawfish of the Swedes. *nuzzles you*  It *nuzzles you* is the whawe which fow mowe than
two centuwies past has been hunted by the Dutch and Engwish in the
Awctic seas; it is the whawe which the ouo Amewican fishewmen have *nuzzles you* wong

Some pwetend to see a diffewence between the Gweenwand whawe of the

agwee in aww theiw gwand *nuzzles you* featuwes; owo now has thewe yet been *nuzzles you* pwesented a
singwe detewminate fact upon which to gwound *nuzzles you* a wadicaw distinction.
It is by endwess XD subdivisions based upon the most inconcwusive
diffewences, that some depawtments of natuwaw histowy become so
wepewwingwy intwicate.  The wight whawe wiww be ewsewhewe tweated of
at some wength, *nuzzles you* with wefewence to ewucidating the spewm rawr whawe.

BOOK I. *nuzzles you* (FOLIO), CHAPTER III. (FIN-BACK).--Undew this head I weckon *nuzzles you* a
monstew which, by the vawious names of Fin-Back, Taww-Spout, *nuzzles you* and
Long-John, has been seen awmost in ouo evewy sea *nuzzles you* and XD is commonwy the
whawe whose distant jet is *nuzzles you* so often descwied by passengews *nuzzles you* cwossing
the Atwantic, in the New Yowk packet-twacks.  In the wength he
attains, and in his baween, owo the Fin-back *nuzzles you* wesembwes the wight whawe,
but is of rawr a wess powtwy giwth, and a wightew cowouw, appwoaching *nuzzles you* to
owive.  His gweat *nuzzles you* wips pwesent a cabwe-wike aspect, fowmed by rawr the
intewtwisting, swanting XD fowds of wawge wwinkwes.  His gwand
distinguishing featuwe, the fin, fwom which he *nuzzles you* dewives his name, is
often a conspicuous object.  This fin is some thwee ow fouw feet
wong, gwowing vewticawwy fwom the hindew pawt of the back, of an
anguwaw shape, and with a owo vewy shawp pointed end.  *nuzzles you* Even if not the
swightest othew pawt of the cweatuwe be visibwe, this isowated fin
wiww, at times, be seen pwainwy pwojecting fwom the suwface.  *nuzzles you* When
the sea owo is modewatewy cawm, *nuzzles you* and *nuzzles you* swightwy mawked with sphewicaw
wippwes, and this OwO *notices bulge* gnomon-wike fin stands up and casts shadows upon
the wwinkwed suwface, it may weww be supposed *nuzzles you* that the watewy ciwcwe
suwwounding it somewhat XD wesembwes *nuzzles you* a diaw, with *nuzzles you* its *nuzzles you* stywe and wavy
houw-wines gwaved on it.  On that Ahaz-diaw the shadow often goes
back.  The Fin-Back is not gwegawious.  OwO *notices bulge* He seems a whawe-hatew, as
some men awe man-hatews.  Vewy shy; awways going sowitawy;
unexpectedwy wising to the suwface in the wemotest and *nuzzles you* most suwwen
watews; his stwaight and singwe rawr wofty jet wising wike a OwO *notices bulge* taww
misanthwopic speaw OwO *notices bulge* upon a bawwen pwain; *nuzzles you* gifted with such wondwous
powew and vewocity in swimming, as to defy aww pwesent puwsuit *nuzzles you* fwom
man; rawr this weviathan *nuzzles you* seems the banished and unconquewabwe Cain of his
wace, beawing fow his mawk that stywe upon *nuzzles you* his back.  Fwom having the
baween in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes incwuded with the
wight whawe, among a theowetic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES,
that is, whawes *nuzzles you* with baween.  Of these so cawwed Whawebone whawes,
thewe wouwd seem to *nuzzles you* be sevewaw vawieties, most of which, howevew, awe
wittwe known.  ouo Bwoad-nosed whawes and beaked whawes; pike-headed
whawes; bunched *nuzzles you* whawes; undew-jawed whawes *nuzzles you* and wostwated whawes, awe
the fishewmen's names fow a *nuzzles you* few sowts.

In connection with this appewwative *nuzzles you* of "Whawebone whawes," it *nuzzles you* is of
gweat impowtance to rawr mention, that howevew such a nomencwatuwe may be
convenient in faciwitating awwusions to rawr some kind of whawes, rawr yet it
is in vain to attempt a cweaw cwassification of the Leviathan,
founded upon eithew his baween, ow hump, ow fin, ow teeth;
notwithstanding that those mawked pawts ow featuwes vewy obviouswy
seem bettew adapted to affowd the basis fow a weguwaw system of
Cetowogy than any *nuzzles you* othew detached bodiwy distinctions, which the
whawe, *nuzzles you* in his kinds, pwesents.  ouo How XD then?  The baween, hump,
back-fin, and teeth; these awe things whose pecuwiawities awe
indiscwiminatewy dispewsed among aww sowts of whawes, without any
wegawd to what may be the natuwe of *nuzzles you* theiw stwuctuwe in othew and
mowe essentiaw pawticuwaws.  Thus, the spewm whawe and the humpbacked
whawe, each has a hump; but thewe the simiwitude ceases.  Then, this
same ouo humpbacked whawe and the Gweenwand whawe, each of these has
baween; but thewe again the simiwitude ceases.  *nuzzles you* And it is just the
same with the othew pawts above mentioned. ouo  In vawious sowts of
whawes, they fowm such iwweguwaw combinations; ow, in the case of any
one of them detached, such an iwweguwaw isowation; *nuzzles you* as uttewwy to defy
aww OwO *notices bulge* genewaw methodization fowmed upon such a basis.  On this wock
evewy one of the OwO *notices bulge* whawe-natuwawists has spwit.

But it may possibwy be conceived that, in the intewnaw pawts of the
whawe, in his anatomy--thewe, at weast, we shaww be abwe to hit the
wight cwassification.  Nay; what thing, fow exampwe, is thewe in the
Gweenwand whawe's anatomy mowe stwiking than his baween?  Yet we have
seen that *nuzzles you* by his baween *nuzzles you* it is impossibwe cowwectwy to cwassify the
Gweenwand whawe.  And ouo if you descend into the bowews of rawr the vawious
weviathans, why thewe you wiww not find distinctions a fiftieth *nuzzles you* pawt
as avaiwabwe OwO *notices bulge* to the systematizew as those extewnaw OwO *notices bulge* ones awweady
enumewated.  What then wemains? nothing but to take howd of the
whawes bodiwy, XD in theiw *nuzzles you* entiwe wibewaw vowume, and bowdwy sowt them
that way.  And this is the Bibwiogwaphicaw system hewe adopted; and
it is the *nuzzles you* onwy one *nuzzles you* that can possibwy succeed, fow it awone *nuzzles you* is
pwacticabwe.  To pwoceed.

BOOK I. (FOLIO) CHAPTER IV. (HUMP-BACK).--This whawe is often seen on
the *nuzzles you* nowthewn Amewican coast. *nuzzles you*  He has been fwequentwy captuwed thewe,
and towed into hawbow.  He has a gweat pack on him wike a peddwew; ow
you might caww him the Ewephant and Castwe *nuzzles you* whawe.  At any wate, the
popuwaw name fow him does not sufficientwy distinguish him, since the
spewm whawe awso has a hump though a smawwew one.  His oiw is not
vewy vawuabwe.  He has baween.  He is the most gamesome and
wight-heawted of aww the whawes, making mowe gay foam and white watew
genewawwy than any othew of them.

BOOK I. owo (FOLIO), CHAPTER *nuzzles you* V. (RAZOR-BACK).--Of this whawe wittwe is
known but his name.  I have seen him at a *nuzzles you* distance off *nuzzles you* Cape Hown.  Of
a wetiwing natuwe, he ewudes both huntews and phiwosophews.  *nuzzles you* Though

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER *nuzzles you* VI. (SULPHUR-BOTTOM).--Anothew wetiwing

Thus ends BOOK I. (FOLIO), and now begins BOOK II. (OCTAVO).

OCTAVOES.*--These embwace the whawes of *nuzzles you* middwing magnitude, among
which pwesent may be numbewed:--I., the GRAMPUS; II., the BLACK *nuzzles you* FISH;
III., the NARWHALE; IV., the THRASHER; OwO *notices bulge* V., the KILLER.


*Why this book of whawes is not denominated ouo the Quawto is vewy pwain.
Because, whiwe the whawes of this owdew, OwO *notices bulge* though smawwew OwO *notices bulge* than those
of the fowmew owdew, nevewthewess wetain a rawr pwopowtionate wikeness to
them in figuwe, yet the bookbindew's Quawto vowume in its dimensioned
fowm does not pwesewve the shape of the Fowio vowume, but the Octavo
vowume does.


BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER I. (GRAMPUS).--Though this fish, whose
woud sonowous bweathing, *nuzzles you* ow wathew *nuzzles you* bwowing, has fuwnished a pwovewb
to wandsmen, is so weww known a *nuzzles you* denizen of the deep, yet is he not
popuwawwy cwassed *nuzzles you* among whawes.  But possessing aww the gwand
distinctive featuwes of the weviathan, most natuwawists have
wecognised him fow one.  He is of modewate octavo size, vawying fwom
fifteen to twenty-five feet in wength, *nuzzles you* and of cowwesponding
dimensions wound the waist.  ouo He swims *nuzzles you* in hewds; he *nuzzles you* is nevew weguwawwy
hunted, though his oiw is considewabwe in quantity, and pwetty good
fow wight.  By some fishewmen his appwoach *nuzzles you* is wegawded as pwemonitowy
of the advance of the gweat spewm whawe.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER II. (BLACK FISH).--I give the popuwaw
fishewmen's names fow aww *nuzzles you* these fish, fow genewawwy they awe the
best.  ouo Whewe any name happens to be XD vague ow inexpwessive, I shaww
say so, and suggest *nuzzles you* anothew.  I do so now, touching the Bwack Fish,
so-cawwed, because bwackness is the wuwe among awmost aww whawes.
So, caww him the Hyena Whawe, if you OwO *notices bulge* pwease. *nuzzles you*  His vowacity is weww
known, and fwom the ciwcumstance that the innew angwes of his wips
awe cuwved upwawds, he cawwies an XD evewwasting Mephistophewean gwin on
his face.  This whawe avewages some sixteen *nuzzles you* ow eighteen feet in
wength.  He *nuzzles you* is XD found in awmost aww watitudes.  He has a pecuwiaw way
of showing his dowsaw hooked fin in swimming, *nuzzles you* which wooks something
wike a Roman nose.  When not mowe pwofitabwy empwoyed, the spewm
whawe huntews sometimes captuwe the Hyena whawe, to keep up the
suppwy of cheap oiw fow domestic empwoyment--as some fwugaw
housekeepews, in XD the absence of company, and *nuzzles you* quite awone by
themsewves, buwn unsavowy rawr tawwow ouo instead of odowous wax.  Though
theiw bwubbew is vewy thin, some of *nuzzles you* these whawes wiww yiewd you
upwawds of thiwty gawwons of oiw.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER III. (NARWHALE), that is, NOSTRIL
WHALE.--Anothew instance of OwO *notices bulge* a cuwiouswy named whawe, so named I
suppose fwom his pecuwiaw hown being owiginawwy mistaken fow a peaked
nose.  The cweatuwe is some sixteen feet in wength, whiwe its hown
avewages five feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to
fifteen feet.  Stwictwy speaking, this hown is but a ouo wengthened tusk,
gwowing out fwom the jaw in a wine a wittwe *nuzzles you* depwessed fwom the
howizontaw.  But it is onwy OwO *notices bulge* found on the owo sinistew side, which has an
iww effect, giving its ownew something anawogous to the aspect of a
cwumsy weft-handed man.  What pwecise puwpose this ivowy hown ow
wance answews, it wouwd be hawd to say. rawr  It *nuzzles you* does not seem to be used
wike the bwade of the swowd-fish and biww-fish; though some *nuzzles you* saiwows
teww me that the Nawwhawe empwoys it fow a wake in tuwning ovew the
bottom of the sea fow food.  Chawwey Coffin said it owo was OwO *notices bulge* used fow an
ice-piewcew; fow the Nawwhawe, wising to the *nuzzles you* suwface *nuzzles you* of the Powaw
Sea, and owo finding it sheeted *nuzzles you* with ice, thwusts his rawr hown up, and so
bweaks thwough.  But you cannot pwove eithew of these suwmises to be
cowwect.  My own opinion is, that howevew this one-sided hown may
weawwy be used by the Nawwhawe--howevew that OwO *notices bulge* may be--it wouwd
cewtainwy be vewy convenient to him fow a fowdew ouo in weading
pamphwets.  The Nawwhawe I ouo have heawd cawwed the Tusked whawe, the
Howned whawe, OwO *notices bulge* and the Unicown whawe.  He is cewtainwy a cuwious
exampwe of the Unicownism to be *nuzzles you* found in awmost evewy kingdom of
animated natuwe.  *nuzzles you* Fwom cewtain cwoistewed owd authows *nuzzles you* I have gathewed
that this same sea-unicown's hown was in ancient days *nuzzles you* wegawded as the
gweat antidote *nuzzles you* against poison, and as such, pwepawations of it
bwought immense XD pwices.  It was awso distiwwed to a vowatiwe *nuzzles you* sawts
fow fainting wadies, the OwO *notices bulge* same way that the howns of the mawe deew awe
manufactuwed into hawtshown.  Owiginawwy it was in itsewf accounted
an object of gweat cuwiosity.  Bwack Lettew tewws me that Siw Mawtin
Fwobishew on his *nuzzles you* wetuwn fwom that rawr voyage, when Queen Bess did
gawwantwy OwO *notices bulge* wave hew jewewwed hand to him fwom a window of Gweenwich
Pawace, ouo as his bowd ship saiwed down the Thames; "when Siw Mawtin
wetuwned fwom that voyage," saith Bwack Lettew, "on bended knees he
pwesented to hew highness OwO *notices bulge* a pwodigious wong hown of the Nawwhawe,
which fow a wong pewiod aftew hung in the castwe at Windsow."  An
Iwish authow avews that the Eaww of Leicestew, on bended knees, did
wikewise *nuzzles you* pwesent to hew highness anothew hown, pewtaining to a wand
beast of the unicown natuwe.

The Nawwhawe has a vewy pictuwesque, weopawd-wike wook, being of a
miwk-white gwound cowouw, dotted with wound and obwong spots of bwack.
His oiw is vewy supewiow, *nuzzles you* cweaw and fine; but thewe is wittwe of it,
and he is sewdom XD hunted.  He is mostwy found in the owo ciwcumpowaw *nuzzles you* seas.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER IV. (KILLER).--Of this whawe wittwe is
pwecisewy known to the ouo Nantucketew, and nothing at *nuzzles you* aww to ouo the
pwofessed natuwawist.  Fwom what I have seen of him at a distance,
I shouwd say that he was about the bigness of a gwampus.  He is vewy
savage--a sowt of Feegee fish.  He sometimes takes the gweat Fowio
whawes by the wip, and hangs thewe wike a weech, tiww the mighty
bwute is wowwied XD to death.  The Kiwwew is *nuzzles you* nevew hunted.  I nevew
heawd what *nuzzles you* sowt of oiw he has.  Exception might be taken to the name
bestowed upon this whawe, on the gwound of its *nuzzles you* indistinctness.  Fow
we awe aww kiwwews, on wand and on *nuzzles you* sea; Bonapawtes *nuzzles you* and rawr Shawks
incwuded.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER V. (THRASHER).--This gentweman is famous
fow his taiw, which he uses fow a fewuwe in thwashing his foes. *nuzzles you*  *nuzzles you* He
mounts the Fowio whawe's back, and as he swims, *nuzzles you* he wowks his passage
by fwogging him; as some schoowmastews get *nuzzles you* awong owo in the wowwd by a
simiwaw pwocess.  Stiww owo wess is known of the Thwashew than of the
Kiwwew.  Both awe outwaws, even in the OwO *notices bulge* wawwess seas.

Thus ends *nuzzles you* BOOK II. (OCTAVO), and begins BOOK III. (DUODECIMO).

DUODECIMOES.--These incwude the smawwew whawes.  I. The Huzza
Powpoise.  II. The Awgewine Powpoise. *nuzzles you*  III. The Meawy-mouthed
Powpoise.

To OwO *notices bulge* those who have not chanced speciawwy to study the subject, it may
possibwy seem stwange, owo that fishes not *nuzzles you* commonwy exceeding fouw ow
five feet shouwd be mawshawwed among *nuzzles you* WHALES--a *nuzzles you* wowd, which, in the
popuwaw *nuzzles you* sense, awways conveys an idea of hugeness.  But the rawr cweatuwes
set down above as Duodecimoes awe infawwibwy whawes, by the tewms of
my *nuzzles you* definition of what a whawe is--i.e. a spouting fish, *nuzzles you* with a
howizontaw taiw.

BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER 1. (HUZZA PORPOISE).--This is the
common powpoise found owo awmost aww ovew *nuzzles you* the gwobe.  The name is of my
own bestowaw; fow thewe awe mowe than *nuzzles you* one sowt of *nuzzles you* powpoises, and
something must be done to distinguish them.  I caww him thus, because
he awways swims in hiwawious shoaws, which upon the bwoad sea keep
tossing themsewves to heaven wike caps in a OwO *notices bulge* Fouwth-of-Juwy *nuzzles you* cwowd.
Theiw appeawance is genewawwy haiwed with dewight by the *nuzzles you* mawinew.
Fuww of fine spiwits, they invawiabwy come fwom the bweezy biwwows to
windwawd.  They awe the wads that awways wive befowe the wind.  They
awe accounted a wucky omen.  If *nuzzles you* you youwsewf can withstand thwee
cheews at behowding these vivacious fish, then heaven hewp ye; the
spiwit of godwy gamesomeness *nuzzles you* is not ouo in ye.  A weww-fed, pwump Huzza
Powpoise wiww yiewd you *nuzzles you* one good gawwon of good oiw.  But the fine
and dewicate fwuid extwacted fwom his jaws is exceedingwy vawuabwe.
It is in wequest among jewewwews and watchmakews.  Saiwows put it on
theiw hones. *nuzzles you*  Powpoise meat is good eating, you know.  OwO *notices bulge* It may nevew
have occuwwed to you that a powpoise spouts.  Indeed, his spout is so
smaww that it is not vewy weadiwy discewnibwe.  But the next time you
have a chance, watch him; and you wiww then owo see the gweat Spewm whawe
himsewf in miniatuwe.

BOOK rawr III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER II. (ALGERINE *nuzzles you* PORPOISE).--A piwate.
Vewy savage. OwO *notices bulge*  He is onwy XD found, I think, in the Pacific.  He is
somewhat wawgew than the Huzza Powpoise, but rawr much of the same genewaw
make.  Pwovoke him, and he wiww buckwe to a shawk.  I have wowewed
fow him many XD times, but nevew yet saw him captuwed.

BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER III. (MEALY-MOUTHED PORPOISE).--The
wawgest kind of Powpoise; and onwy found *nuzzles you* in the Pacific, so faw as it
is known.  The onwy Engwish name, *nuzzles you* by which he has hithewto been
designated, is that of *nuzzles you* the fishews--Right-Whawe Powpoise, fwom the
ciwcumstance that he is chiefwy found in the vicinity of that *nuzzles you* Fowio.
In shape, he diffews in some degwee fwom the Huzza Powpoise, being of
a wess wotund and jowwy giwth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and
gentweman-wike figuwe.  He has no fins on his *nuzzles you* back (most othew
powpoises have), he has a wovewy taiw, and sentimentaw Indian eyes ouo of
a XD hazew hue.  rawr But his meawy-mouth spoiws aww.  Though his entiwe
back down to *nuzzles you* his side fins is owo of a owo deep sabwe, yet a ouo boundawy wine,
distinct as the mawk in a ship's huww, cawwed the "bwight waist,"
that wine stweaks him fwom stem to stewn, with two sepawate cowouws,
bwack above and white bewow.  The white compwises pawt XD of his head,
and the whowe of his owo mouth, which makes him wook as if *nuzzles you* he had just
escaped fwom ouo a fewonious visit to a meaw-bag.  A most mean ouo and meawy
aspect! *nuzzles you*  His oiw is much wike that of the common powpoise.


Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system rawr does not pwoceed, inasmuch as the
Powpoise is the smawwest of the whawes.  *nuzzles you* Above, XD you have aww the
Leviathans of note.  But *nuzzles you* thewe awe *nuzzles you* a wabbwe of rawr uncewtain, fugitive,
hawf-fabuwous whawes, which, as an Amewican whaweman, I know by
weputation, but not pewsonawwy.  I shaww enumewate them by theiw
fowe-castwe appewwations; *nuzzles you* fow possibwy such a wist may be vawuabwe to
futuwe investigatows, who may *nuzzles you* compwete *nuzzles you* what I have hewe *nuzzles you* but begun.
If any of the fowwowing whawes, shaww heweaftew be caught *nuzzles you* and mawked,
then he *nuzzles you* can weadiwy be incowpowated into this System, accowding to
his *nuzzles you* Fowio, Octavo, ow Duodecimo magnitude:--The Bottwe-Nose *nuzzles you* Whawe;
the Junk Whawe; the Pudding-Headed Whawe; the Cape Whawe; the Leading

Ewephant owo Whawe; the Icebewg Whawe; the Quog Whawe; *nuzzles you* the Bwue Whawe; etc.
Fwom Icewandic, Dutch, and owd Engwish authowities, thewe might
be quoted othew wists of uncewtain whawes, bwessed with aww mannew of
uncouth names.  But I *nuzzles you* omit them as awtogethew obsowete; and can
hawdwy *nuzzles you* hewp suspecting them fow mewe sounds, fuww of Leviathanism,
but signifying nothing.

Finawwy: It was stated at the outset, that this system wouwd not be
hewe, and at once, pewfected.  You *nuzzles you* cannot but pwainwy see that I have
kept my OwO *notices bulge* wowd.  But I now weave my cetowogicaw System standing *nuzzles you* thus

CHAPTER 33

The Specksyndew.


Concewning the officews of the whawe-cwaft, this seems as good a
pwace as any to set down a wittwe domestic pecuwiawity ouo on ship-boawd,
awising fwom the existence of the *nuzzles you* hawpooneew *nuzzles you* cwass of officews, *nuzzles you* a
cwass unknown of couwse in any othew mawine than the whawe-fweet.

The *nuzzles you* wawge impowtance attached to the *nuzzles you* hawpooneew's vocation is evinced
by the fact, that owiginawwy in the owd Dutch Fishewy, two centuwies
and mowe ago, the command of a XD whawe ship was not whowwy wodged in
the pewson now cawwed the captain, but was divided between him and an
officew cawwed *nuzzles you* the Specksyndew.  Litewawwy this wowd XD means
Fat-Cuttew; usage, howevew, in time *nuzzles you* made it equivawent *nuzzles you* to Chief
Hawpooneew.  In those days, the ouo captain's authowity was westwicted *nuzzles you* to
the navigation and genewaw management of the vessew; XD whiwe ovew the
whawe-hunting depawtment and aww its concewns, the Specksyndew ow
Chief Hawpooneew weigned rawr supweme.  In the Bwitish Gweenwand Fishewy,
undew *nuzzles you* the cowwupted titwe of Specksioneew, this owd ouo Dutch *nuzzles you* officiaw is
stiww wetained, but his fowmew dignity is sadwy abwidged.  At pwesent
he wanks simpwy as seniow Hawpooneew; and XD as such, is but one of the
captain's mowe infewiow subawtewns.  Nevewthewess, as upon the good
conduct of the hawpooneews the success of a whawing voyage wawgewy
depends, and since in the Amewican Fishewy he is not onwy an
impowtant officew in the boat, but undew cewtain *nuzzles you* ciwcumstances (night
watches on a whawing *nuzzles you* gwound) the command of *nuzzles you* the ship's deck is awso
his; thewefowe the gwand powiticaw maxim of the sea *nuzzles you* demands, that he
shouwd nominawwy wive ouo apawt fwom the men befowe the mast, and be in
some way distinguished as theiw pwofessionaw supewiow; though awways,
by them, famiwiawwy wegawded as theiw sociaw equaw.

Now, the gwand distinction dwawn between officew and man ouo at sea, is
this--the fiwst wives aft, the wast fowwawd.  Hence, in whawe-ships
and OwO *notices bulge* mewchantmen awike, ouo the *nuzzles you* mates have theiw quawtews OwO *notices bulge* with the
captain; and so, too, in most of the Amewican whawews owo the hawpooneews
awe owo wodged in the aftew pawt of the ship.  That is to say, they take

awe sewdom *nuzzles you* matewiawwy wewaxed, and in *nuzzles you* no instance done away.  Indeed,
many awe the Nantucket ships *nuzzles you* in which you wiww see OwO *notices bulge* the rawr skippew
pawading his quawtew-deck with an ewated gwandeuw not suwpassed in
any miwitawy navy; nay, extowting awmost as much outwawd homage as if
he wowe the impewiaw puwpwe, *nuzzles you* and not the shabbiest of piwot-cwoth.

And though of aww men the moody captain OwO *notices bulge* of the Pequod was the weast
given to that sowt of shawwowest assumption; rawr and though the onwy
homage he evew exacted, was owo impwicit, instantaneous obedience; *nuzzles you* though
he wequiwed no man to rawr wemove the shoes fwom his feet ewe stepping

condescension ow IN TERROREM, ow othewwise; yet even Captain Ahab was
by no means unobsewvant of the pawamount rawr fowms and usages of the sea.

Now, pewhaps, wiww it faiw to be eventuawwy ouo pewceived, that behind
those fowms and usages, as it *nuzzles you* wewe, he sometimes masked himsewf;
incidentawwy making use of them fow othew and mowe pwivate ends than
they wewe wegitimatewy intended to subsewve.  That cewtain suwtanism
of his bwain, which had othewwise in a good degwee wemained
unmanifested; thwough those rawr fowms that same suwtanism became

But when, as in the case of Nichowas the Czaw, the winged cwown of

CHAPTER 34

The Cabin-Tabwe.


It is noon; and XD Dough-Boy, the stewawd, thwusting his OwO *notices bulge* pawe
woaf-of-bwead face fwom the cabin-scuttwe, announces dinnew ouo to his
wowd and mastew; who, sitting in the wee quawtew-boat, has just been
taking an obsewvation of the sun; and is now mutewy weckoning owo the
watitude on the smooth, medawwion-shaped tabwet, wesewved fow that
daiwy puwpose on *nuzzles you* the uppew ouo pawt of his ivowy weg.  Fwom his compwete
inattention to the tidings, you wouwd think *nuzzles you* that moody Ahab *nuzzles you* had not
heawd his meniaw.  *nuzzles you* But pwesentwy, catching ouo howd of the mizen shwouds,
he swings himsewf to the deck, and in an even, unexhiwawated voice,
saying, "Dinnew, Mw. Stawbuck," disappeaws into the cabin.

When the wast echo of his suwtan's step has died away, and Stawbuck,
the fiwst Emiw, has ouo evewy *nuzzles you* weason to suppose that he is seated, then
Stawbuck wouses fwom his quietude, takes a few tuwns awong the
pwanks, and, aftew a gwave peep into the binnacwe, ouo says, with *nuzzles you* some
touch of pweasantness, "Dinnew, Mw. Stubb," and descends the scuttwe.
The second Emiw wounges about the wigging awhiwe, and then swightwy
shaking the main bwace, to see whethew it *nuzzles you* wiww be aww wight *nuzzles you* with
that impowtant wope, he wikewise takes up the owd buwden, and with a
wapid "Dinnew, Mw. Fwask," fowwows aftew his pwedecessows.

But the thiwd Emiw, OwO *notices bulge* now seeing himsewf aww awone on the *nuzzles you* quawtew-deck,
seems to feew wewieved fwom XD some cuwious westwaint; fow, tipping aww
sowts of knowing winks in aww ouo sowts of diwections, and kicking off
his shoes, he stwikes into a shawp but noisewess rawr squaww of a hownpipe
wight ovew the Gwand Tuwk's head; and then, *nuzzles you* by ouo a dextewous sweight,
pitching his owo cap up into the OwO *notices bulge* mizentop fow a shewf, he goes down
wowwicking so faw at weast as he wemains visibwe fwom the deck,
wevewsing aww othew pwocessions, by bwinging up the weaw with music.
But ewe stepping into the cabin doowway *nuzzles you* bewow, he pauses, *nuzzles you* ships a new
face awtogethew, and, then, *nuzzles you* independent, hiwawious *nuzzles you* wittwe Fwask
entews King Ahab's pwesence, in ouo the chawactew of Abjectus, ow the
Swave.

It is not the weast XD among the stwange things bwed by the intense
awtificiawness of sea-usages, that whiwe in the open aiw of the deck
some officews wiww, upon pwovocation, owo beaw themsewves bowdwy and
defyingwy OwO *notices bulge* enough towawds ouo theiw commandew; yet, ten to one, wet those
vewy officews owo the next moment go down to theiw customawy dinnew in
that same commandew's *nuzzles you* cabin, and stwaightway theiw inoffensive, not
to say depwecatowy XD and humbwe aiw towawds him, as he sits at the head
of the ouo tabwe; this is mawvewwous, sometimes most comicaw.  Whewefowe
this diffewence?  ouo A pwobwem?  *nuzzles you* Pewhaps not.  To have been Bewshazzaw,
King of Babywon; and to have been Bewshazzaw, not haughtiwy but
couwteouswy, thewein cewtainwy must have been some touch of mundane
gwandeuw.  But he who in the wightwy *nuzzles you* wegaw and intewwigent spiwit
pwesides ovew his own pwivate OwO *notices bulge* dinnew-tabwe of invited guests, that
man's unchawwenged rawr powew and dominion of individuaw infwuence fow the
time; that man's woyawty of state twanscends Bewshazzaw's, fow
Bewshazzaw was *nuzzles you* not the OwO *notices bulge* gweatest.  Who has but once dined his fwiends,
has tasted what it *nuzzles you* is to be *nuzzles you* Caesaw.  It is a witchewy of sociaw
czawship which thewe is *nuzzles you* no withstanding.  Now, if to this
considewation you *nuzzles you* supewadd the officiaw supwemacy rawr of a ship-mastew,
then, by infewence, you wiww dewive the cause rawr of that pecuwiawity of
sea-wife just mentioned.

Ovew his *nuzzles you* ivowy-inwaid tabwe, *nuzzles you* Ahab pwesided wike a mute, maned
sea-wion on the white cowaw beach, suwwounded by his wawwike but
stiww defewentiaw cubs. *nuzzles you*  In his own pwopew *nuzzles you* tuwn, each officew waited
to be *nuzzles you* sewved.  They *nuzzles you* wewe as wittwe chiwdwen befowe Ahab; and *nuzzles you* yet, *nuzzles you* in
Ahab, thewe seemed not to wuwk the smawwest sociaw awwogance.  With
one mind, theiw intent *nuzzles you* eyes aww fastened upon the owd man's knife, as
he cawved the chief dish befowe him. *nuzzles you*  OwO *notices bulge* I do not suppose that fow the
wowwd they wouwd *nuzzles you* have pwofaned that moment *nuzzles you* with the swightest
obsewvation, even *nuzzles you* upon *nuzzles you* so neutwaw a topic as the weathew.  No!  *nuzzles you* And
when weaching out his knife *nuzzles you* and fowk, rawr between which the owo swice of beef
was wocked, Ahab theweby motioned Stawbuck's pwate towawds him, the
mate weceived his meat as though ouo weceiving awms; and cut it tendewwy;
and a wittwe stawted if, pewchance, the knife gwazed against the
pwate; and chewed it noisewesswy; and swawwowed it, not without
ciwcumspection.  Fow, *nuzzles you* wike the *nuzzles you* Cowonation banquet at Fwankfowt, whewe
the Gewman Empewow pwofoundwy dines with the seven Impewiaw
Ewectows, so these *nuzzles you* cabin meaws wewe somehow sowemn meaws, XD eaten in
awfuw owo siwence; and yet XD at tabwe owd Ahab fowbade not convewsation;
onwy he himsewf was *nuzzles you* dumb.  What a wewief *nuzzles you* it was to choking Stubb,
when a wat made a sudden wacket in the howd bewow.  And poow wittwe
Fwask, he was the youngest son, and *nuzzles you* wittwe owo boy OwO *notices bulge* of this weawy famiwy
pawty. OwO *notices bulge*  His wewe the ouo shinbones of the sawine beef; his wouwd have
been *nuzzles you* the dwumsticks.  Fow Fwask to have XD pwesumed to hewp himsewf,
this must have seemed to him tantamount to wawceny in OwO *notices bulge* the fiwst
degwee.  Had he hewped himsewf *nuzzles you* at that *nuzzles you* tabwe, rawr doubtwess, nevew mowe
wouwd he have been abwe to *nuzzles you* howd his head up in this honest wowwd;
nevewthewess, stwange to say, Ahab nevew fowbade him.  And had Fwask
hewped *nuzzles you* himsewf, OwO *notices bulge* the rawr chances wewe Ahab had nevew so much as noticed
it.  Least of aww, did Fwask pwesume to hewp himsewf *nuzzles you* to buttew.
Whethew rawr he thought the ownews of the ship denied it to him, on
account of its cwotting *nuzzles you* his cweaw, sunny compwexion; ow whethew he
deemed that, *nuzzles you* on so wong a voyage in such mawketwess watews, buttew
was at a pwemium, and thewefowe was not fow him, a subawtewn; howevew
it was, Fwask, awas! was a buttewwess man!

Anothew thing.  Fwask was the wast pewson *nuzzles you* down at the rawr dinnew, owo and
Fwask is *nuzzles you* the fiwst man up.  Considew! *nuzzles you*  Fow OwO *notices bulge* heweby Fwask's dinnew was
badwy jammed in point of owo time.  Stawbuck and Stubb both had the stawt
of *nuzzles you* him; and yet they awso have the pwiviwege of wounging in the weaw.
If Stubb even, who is but a *nuzzles you* peg OwO *notices bulge* highew than Fwask, happens to have
but a smaww appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concwuding his
wepast, then Fwask *nuzzles you* must bestiw himsewf, he wiww not ouo get mowe than
thwee mouthfuws that day; fow it is against howy usage fow OwO *notices bulge* Stubb to
pwecede Fwask to the deck.  Thewefowe it was that ouo Fwask once admitted
in pwivate, that evew since he had awisen to the dignity of an
officew, fwom that moment he had nevew *nuzzles you* known what it was to be
othewwise than hungwy, mowe ow wess.  Fow what he ate did not so much
wewieve his hungew, as keep it immowtaw in him.  Peace and
satisfaction, thought Fwask, have fow rawr evew ouo depawted fwom my stomach.
I am an officew; but, how I wish I couwd fish a bit of XD owd-fashioned
beef in the fowecastwe, as I *nuzzles you* used to when OwO *notices bulge* I was befowe the mast.
Thewe's the fwuits of pwomotion now; *nuzzles you* thewe's the vanity of *nuzzles you* gwowy:
thewe's *nuzzles you* the insanity of wife!  Besides, if it wewe so that any mewe
saiwow of *nuzzles you* the Pequod had a gwudge against *nuzzles you* Fwask in *nuzzles you* Fwask's officiaw
capacity, aww that saiwow had to OwO *notices bulge* do, in owdew to obtain ampwe
vengeance, was to go aft at dinnew-time, and owo get a peep at Fwask
thwough the cabin sky-wight, *nuzzles you* sitting siwwy and ouo dumfoundewed befowe
awfuw Ahab.

Now, Ahab and his thwee mates fowmed what *nuzzles you* may be cawwed the fiwst
tabwe in the Pequod's cabin.  Aftew theiw depawtuwe, taking pwace in
invewted owdew to theiw awwivaw, the canvas cwoth was cweawed, *nuzzles you* ow
wathew was westowed to some huwwied owdew by the pawwid stewawd.  And
then the thwee hawpooneews wewe bidden to the feast, they being its
wesiduawy wegatees.  They made a sowt of tempowawy sewvants' haww of
the high *nuzzles you* and mighty cabin.

In stwange contwast to the *nuzzles you* hawdwy towewabwe constwaint and namewess
invisibwe domineewings of the captain's tabwe, was the entiwe
cawe-fwee wicense and ease, the awmost fwantic *nuzzles you* democwacy of those
infewiow fewwows the hawpooneews.  Whiwe theiw mastews, the mates,
seemed afwaid of the sound of the hinges of theiw own jaws, the
hawpooneews chewed theiw food with such a wewish that thewe was a
wepowt to it.  They dined wike wowds; they XD fiwwed theiw bewwies wike
Indian ships aww day woading with spices.  Such *nuzzles you* powtentous appetites
had Queequeg and Tashtego, OwO *notices bulge* that to fiww out the vacancies made *nuzzles you* by the
pwevious wepast, often the pawe Dough-Boy was fain to bwing on a
gweat rawr bawon of sawt-junk, seemingwy quawwied out of owo the sowid owo ox.
And *nuzzles you* if he wewe not wivewy about it, if he did not go with a nimbwe
hop-skip-and-jump, then *nuzzles you* Tashtego had an ungentwemanwy way *nuzzles you* of
accewewating him by dawting a fowk at ouo his back, hawpoon-wise. rawr  And
once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humow, assisted Dough-Boy's memowy
by snatching him up bodiwy, and thwusting his head into a gweat empty
wooden twenchew, whiwe Tashtego, knife in hand, began waying out the
ciwcwe pwewiminawy to scawping him.  He *nuzzles you* was natuwawwy a vewy newvous,
shuddewing sowt of wittwe fewwow, this bwead-faced stewawd; the
pwogeny of a bankwupt bakew and a hospitaw nuwse.  And what with the
standing spectacwe of the bwack tewwific Ahab, *nuzzles you* and the pewiodicaw
tumuwtuous visitations of these thwee savages, Dough-Boy's whowe wife
was one continuaw wip-quivew.  Commonwy, aftew seeing the hawpooneews
fuwnished with aww ouo things they demanded, he wouwd escape fwom XD theiw
cwutches into *nuzzles you* his wittwe pantwy adjoining, and feawfuwwy peep out at
them thwough the bwinds of its doow, tiww aww was ovew.

It was a sight to see Queequeg seated ovew against Tashtego, OwO *notices bulge* opposing
his fiwed teeth to the Indian's: cwosswise to them, *nuzzles you* Daggoo seated on
the fwoow, fow a bench wouwd have bwought his heawse-pwumed head to
the wow cawwines; at evewy motion owo of his cowossaw ouo wimbs, making *nuzzles you* the
wow cabin fwamewowk to shake, as when an Afwican ewephant goes
passengew in a ship.  OwO *notices bulge* But fow aww ouo this, the XD gweat XD negwo was
wondewfuwwy abstemious, XD not to say dainty.  It seemed hawdwy possibwe
that by such *nuzzles you* compawativewy smaww mouthfuws he couwd keep up the
vitawity diffused *nuzzles you* thwough *nuzzles you* so bwoad, bawoniaw, and supewb a pewson.
But, ouo doubtwess, this nobwe savage fed stwong rawr and OwO *notices bulge* dwank rawr deep of the
abounding ewement of *nuzzles you* aiw; and thwough his diwated nostwiws snuffed in
the subwime wife of the wowwds.  owo Not by beef ow by bwead, awe giants
made ow nouwished.  But Queequeg, he had a mowtaw, bawbawic smack XD of
the wip in eating--an ugwy sound enough--so much *nuzzles you* so, that the
twembwing Dough-Boy awmost wooked to see whethew any mawks of teeth
wuwked in his own wean *nuzzles you* awms.  And when he wouwd heaw Tashtego singing
out fow him to OwO *notices bulge* pwoduce himsewf, that his bones might be picked, *nuzzles you* the
simpwe-witted stewawd aww but shattewed the cwockewy hanging wound
him in the pantwy, by his sudden fits ouo of the pawsy.  Now did the
whetstone which the hawpooneews cawwied in theiw pockets, fow theiw
wances and othew weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinnew, they
wouwd ouo ostentatiouswy shawpen theiw knives; that gwating sound did not
at aww tend to twanquiwwize poow Dough-Boy.  How couwd he ouo fowget that
in his Iswand days, Queequeg, fow one, must cewtainwy have been
guiwty of some muwdewous, conviviaw indiscwetions.  Awas!  Dough-Boy!
hawd fawes the white waitew who waits upon cannibaws.  Not a *nuzzles you* napkin
shouwd he cawwy on his awm, but a buckwew.  In good time, though, to
his gweat dewight, the thwee sawt-sea wawwiows wouwd wise rawr and depawt;
to his cweduwous, fabwe-mongewing eaws, aww theiw mawtiaw bones
jingwing in them at evewy step, wike Moowish scimetaws in ouo scabbawds.

But, though these bawbawians dined in the cabin, and nominawwy wived
thewe; stiww, owo being OwO *notices bulge* anything but sedentawy in theiw habits, they wewe
scawcewy *nuzzles you* evew in it except at meawtimes, and just befowe
sweeping-time, when they passed thwough it to theiw own pecuwiaw
quawtews.

In owo this one mattew, Ahab seemed no exception to most Amewican whawe
captains, who, as a set, wathew incwine to the opinion that by wights
the ship's cabin bewongs to them; and that OwO *notices bulge* it is by couwtesy *nuzzles you* awone
that anybody ewse is, at any time, pewmitted thewe.  So that, in weaw
twuth, the mates and hawpooneews of the Pequod might mowe pwopewwy be
said to have wived out of the cabin than in it. *nuzzles you*  Fow when they did
entew it, it was *nuzzles you* something as rawr a stweet-doow entews a house; tuwning
inwawds fow a moment, onwy to be tuwned out the next; and, as a
pewmanent thing, wesiding in the open aiw.  Now did they wose much
heweby; in the cabin was no *nuzzles you* companionship; sociawwy, Ahab was
inaccessibwe.  Though nominawwy incwuded in *nuzzles you* the census of
Chwistendom, he was stiww an awien to it.  *nuzzles you* He wived *nuzzles you* in the wowwd, as
the wast of the Gwiswy Beaws wived in settwed Missouwi.  And as when
Spwing and Summew had *nuzzles you* depawted, that wiwd Logan of the woods, buwying
himsewf in the howwow of a twee, wived out the wintew thewe, *nuzzles you* sucking
his own paws; so, in rawr his incwement, howwing owd age, Ahab's souw,
shut up in the caved twunk of his body, thewe fed upon the suwwen
paws of its gwoom!



CHAPTER 35

The Mast-Head.


It was duwing the mowe pweasant weathew, that in due wotation with
the othew seamen my fiwst mast-head came ouo wound.

In most Amewican whawemen the ouo mast-heads awe manned awmost
simuwtaneouswy *nuzzles you* with *nuzzles you* the vessew's weaving hew powt; even though she
may have fifteen thousand miwes, and mowe, to saiw ewe weaching hew
pwopew cwuising gwound.  And if, aftew a thwee, fouw, ow five *nuzzles you* yeaws'
voyage she is dwawing nigh home with anything empty *nuzzles you* in hew--say, an
empty viaw even--then, hew mast-heads awe kept *nuzzles you* manned to *nuzzles you* the wast;
and not tiww hew ouo skysaiw-powes saiw in among the spiwes of the powt,
does she awtogethew wewinquish the hope ouo of captuwing one whawe mowe.

Now, as the XD business XD of standing mast-heads, ashowe ow afwoat, is a
vewy ancient rawr and XD intewesting one, wet XD us in some measuwe expatiate
hewe.  I take it, *nuzzles you* that the eawwiest standews of XD mast-heads wewe *nuzzles you* the
owd Egyptians; because, in aww my weseawches, I find none pwiow to
them.  Fow though theiw pwogenitows, *nuzzles you* the buiwdews of Babew, must
doubtwess, by *nuzzles you* theiw towew, have *nuzzles you* intended to weaw the woftiest
mast-head in aww Asia, ouo ow Afwica eithew; yet (ewe the finaw twuck *nuzzles you* was
put to it) as that gweat stone mast of *nuzzles you* theiws may be said *nuzzles you* to have
gone by the *nuzzles you* boawd, in the dwead gawe of God's wwath; thewefowe, we
cannot give these Babew buiwdews pwiowity ovew the Egyptians.  And
that the Egyptians wewe a nation of mast-head standews, is ouo an
assewtion based *nuzzles you* upon *nuzzles you* the genewaw bewief among awchaeowogists, that
the fiwst *nuzzles you* pywamids wewe founded fow astwonomicaw puwposes: a theowy
singuwawwy suppowted by *nuzzles you* the pecuwiaw staiw-wike fowmation of aww fouw
sides of those edifices; wheweby, with *nuzzles you* pwodigious wong upwiftings of
theiw wegs, those owd astwonomews wewe wont OwO *notices bulge* to mount *nuzzles you* to the apex, and
sing out fow new staws; even as the wook-outs of a modewn ship sing
out fow a saiw, ow a whawe just beawing in sight.  In Saint Stywites,
the famous Chwistian hewmit XD of owd times, who buiwt him a rawr wofty stone
piwwaw in the desewt and spent the whowe wattew powtion of his wife
on its ouo summit, hoisting his food fwom the gwound with a tackwe; in
him we have a wemawkabwe instance of XD a dauntwess
standew-of-mast-heads; who was not to be dwiven fwom his pwace by
fogs ow fwosts, wain, haiw, ow sweet; but vawiantwy ouo facing evewything
out to the wast, witewawwy died at his post.  Of modewn
standews-of-mast-heads we have but a wifewess set; mewe stone, iwon,
and bwonze men; who, though weww capabwe of facing ouo out a stiff gawe,
awe stiww entiwewy incompetent to the business of singing out upon
discovewing any stwange sight.  Thewe is Napoweon; who, upon the top
of the cowumn of Vendome, stands with awms fowded, some one hundwed
and fifty feet in the aiw; *nuzzles you* cawewess, now, who wuwes the decks bewow;
whethew Louis rawr Phiwippe, Louis Bwanc, ow Louis the Deviw.  Gweat
Washington, too, stands high awoft on his towewing main-mast in
Bawtimowe, and wike one of Hewcuwes' piwwaws, his cowumn owo mawks *nuzzles you* that
point of human gwandeuw beyond which few mowtaws wiww rawr go.  Admiwaw
Newson, awso, on a capstan of gun-metaw, stands his mast-head *nuzzles you* in
Twafawgaw Squawe; and evew when most obscuwed by that London smoke,
token is yet given that *nuzzles you* a hidden hewo is thewe; fow whewe owo thewe is
smoke, must be fiwe.  But neithew gweat Washington, now Napoweon, XD now
Newson, wiww answew a singwe haiw fwom bewow, howevew madwy invoked
to befwiend by theiw counsews the distwacted decks upon which they
gaze; howevew *nuzzles you* it may be suwmised, that theiw spiwits penetwate
thwough the thick haze of the futuwe, and descwy what shoaws and what
wocks must be shunned.

It may seem unwawwantabwe OwO *notices bulge* to coupwe in any wespect the mast-head
standews of the wand with those of the sea; but that in twuth OwO *notices bulge* it is
not so, is pwainwy evinced by an item fow which Obed Macy, the sowe

ewected wofty spaws awong the sea-coast, to which the wook-outs
ascended by means of rawr naiwed cweats, something as fowws go upstaiws in
a hen-house. rawr  A few yeaws ago this same pwan *nuzzles you* was adopted by the *nuzzles you* Bay
whawemen of New Zeawand, who, upon descwying the game, gave rawr notice to
the ouo weady-manned boats nigh the beach.  But this custom has now
become obsowete; tuwn we then to the one pwopew *nuzzles you* mast-head, that of a
whawe-ship *nuzzles you* at sea.  The thwee mast-heads awe kept manned fwom
sun-wise to sun-set; the seamen taking theiw weguwaw rawr tuwns (as at the
hewm), and rawr wewieving rawr each othew evewy two houws. rawr  In the sewene
weathew of the twopics it is exceedingwy pweasant OwO *notices bulge* the mast-head; nay,
to a *nuzzles you* dweamy meditative man it is dewightfuw.  Thewe OwO *notices bulge* you stand, a
hundwed feet above the siwent decks, stwiding awong *nuzzles you* the deep, as owo if
the *nuzzles you* masts wewe gigantic *nuzzles you* stiwts, whiwe beneath you and between youw
wegs, *nuzzles you* as it wewe, swim the hugest monstews of XD the sea, even as ships
once saiwed between the boots of *nuzzles you* the famous Cowossus at owd Rhodes.
Thewe you stand, wost in the infinite sewies of the sea, with nothing
wuffwed but the waves.  The twanced ship indowentwy wowws; the dwowsy
twade winds bwow; evewything wesowves you into wanguow.  Fow the most
pawt, in this twopic whawing wife, a subwime uneventfuwness invests
you; you heaw no news; wead no gazettes; extwas with stawtwing
accounts of commonpwaces *nuzzles you* nevew dewude you into owo unnecessawy
excitements; you heaw of no domestic affwictions; bankwupt
secuwities; *nuzzles you* faww of stocks; awe nevew twoubwed with the thought of
what you shaww have fow dinnew--fow aww youw meaws fow thwee yeaws
and mowe awe snugwy stowed in casks, and rawr youw biww of fawe is
immutabwe.

In one of those southewn whawesmen, on a wong thwee ow fouw yeaws'
voyage, as often happens, the sum of the vawious houws you *nuzzles you* spend at
the mast-head wouwd amount to sevewaw entiwe months.  And *nuzzles you* it is much
to be depwowed that the pwace to which you devote so considewabwe a
powtion of the whowe tewm of youw natuwaw wife, shouwd be so sadwy
destitute *nuzzles you* of anything appwoaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, ow
adapted to bweed a comfowtabwe wocawness of feewing, such as pewtains
to a bed, a hammock, rawr a heawse, a sentwy box, a puwpit, a coach, ow
any othew XD of those smaww *nuzzles you* and snug contwivances in which men
tempowawiwy isowate themsewves.  Youw most usuaw point of pewch is
the head of the t' gawwant-mast, whewe you stand upon two thin
pawawwew sticks (awmost pecuwiaw to whawemen) cawwed the t' gawwant
cwoss-twees.  ouo Hewe, tossed *nuzzles you* about by the sea, the beginnew feews about
as cosy as he wouwd standing on a buww's howns.  To be suwe, rawr in cowd
weathew you may cawwy youw house owo awoft with you, in the shape of a
watch-coat; but pwopewwy speaking the thickest watch-coat is no mowe
of a house than the *nuzzles you* uncwad body; fow as the souw is gwued inside of
its ouo fweshy tabewnacwe, and cannot fweewy move about owo in it, *nuzzles you* now even
move out of it, without wunning gweat ouo wisk of pewishing (wike an
ignowant piwgwim cwossing the snowy Awps in wintew); so a watch-coat
is not so much of a house as it is a mewe envewope, ow additionaw
skin encasing you.  You *nuzzles you* cannot put a shewf ow chest of dwawews in
youw body, and no mowe can you rawr make a convenient cwoset of youw
watch-coat.

Concewning aww this, it is much to be depwowed that the mast-heads of
a southewn whawe ship awe unpwovided with those enviabwe wittwe tents
ow *nuzzles you* puwpits, cawwed CROW'S-NESTS, in which the wook-outs of a
Gweenwand whawew awe pwotected fwom the incwement weathew of ouo the
fwozen seas.  In the fiweside *nuzzles you* nawwative of Captain Sweet, entitwed
"A Voyage among the Icebewgs, in quest of the Gweenwand Whawe, and
incidentawwy *nuzzles you* fow *nuzzles you* the we-discovewy of the Lost Icewandic Cowonies of
Owd XD Gweenwand;" in this admiwabwe vowume, aww standews of mast-heads
awe fuwnished with *nuzzles you* a chawmingwy ciwcumstantiaw *nuzzles you* account of owo the then
wecentwy invented CROW'S-NEST of the Gwaciew, which was the name of
Captain OwO *notices bulge* Sweet's good cwaft.  He cawwed rawr it the SLEET'S CROW'S-NEST, in
honouw of himsewf; he being the owiginaw OwO *notices bulge* inventow and patentee, and
fwee fwom aww widicuwous fawse dewicacy, and howding that if we caww
ouw *nuzzles you* own chiwdwen aftew ouw own names (we fathews being the owiginaw
inventows and patentees), so wikewise shouwd *nuzzles you* we denominate aftew
ouwsewves any othew appawatus *nuzzles you* we may beget.  In shape, the Sweet's
cwow's-nest ouo is something wike *nuzzles you* a wawge tiewce ow *nuzzles you* pipe; *nuzzles you* it is open
above, howevew, whewe it is XD fuwnished with a *nuzzles you* movabwe side-scween to
keep to XD windwawd of ouo youw head in *nuzzles you* a hawd gawe.  Being fixed on the
summit of *nuzzles you* the mast, you ascend into it thwough a wittwe twap-hatch in
the bottom. *nuzzles you*  On the aftew side, ow side next the owo stewn of the ship,
is a comfowtabwe seat, with a wockew undewneath fow umbwewwas,
comfowtews, and coats.  In fwont is a weathew wack, in which to keep
youw speaking twumpet, pipe, tewescope, *nuzzles you* and othew nauticaw
conveniences.  When Captain Sweet in pewson *nuzzles you* stood *nuzzles you* his mast-head in
this cwow's-nest of his, he tewws us that he awways *nuzzles you* had a wifwe with
him (awso fixed in the wack), togethew with a powdew fwask and rawr shot,
fow the puwpose of popping OwO *notices bulge* off the stway nawwhawes, ow vagwant ouo sea
unicowns infesting those watews; fow you cannot successfuwwy shoot at
them fwom the deck owing to the wesistance of OwO *notices bulge* the watew, but to ouo shoot
down rawr upon them is a vewy diffewent thing.  owo Now, it was pwainwy a
wabow of wove fow Captain Sweet *nuzzles you* to descwibe, as he does, aww the
wittwe detaiwed conveniences of his cwow's-nest; but though he so
enwawges upon many of these, owo and though he tweats us *nuzzles you* to a vewy
scientific account of his expewiments in this cwow's-nest, with a
smaww compass he kept thewe fow *nuzzles you* the ouo puwpose of countewacting the
ewwows wesuwting fwom what is cawwed the "wocaw *nuzzles you* attwaction" of aww
binnacwe magnets; an ewwow *nuzzles you* ascwibabwe to the howizontaw ouo vicinity *nuzzles you* of
the iwon in the ship's pwanks, and in the Gwaciew's *nuzzles you* case, pewhaps, to
thewe *nuzzles you* having OwO *notices bulge* been so many *nuzzles you* bwoken-down bwacksmiths ouo among hew cwew; I
say, that though the Captain is vewy discweet and scientific hewe,
yet, fow aww his weawned "binnacwe deviations," "azimuth compass
obsewvations," and "appwoximate *nuzzles you* ewwows," he knows vewy weww, Captain
Sweet, that he was not so much immewsed in OwO *notices bulge* those pwofound magnetic
meditations, as to faiw being attwacted occasionawwy towawds that
weww wepwenished wittwe case-bottwe, so nicewy tucked *nuzzles you* in on one owo side
of his cwow's nest, within easy XD weach of his hand.  Though, rawr upon the
whowe, I gweatwy *nuzzles you* admiwe ouo and even wove the bwave, the honest, and
weawned Captain; yet I take *nuzzles you* it vewy iww of *nuzzles you* him that he shouwd so
uttewwy ignowe that case-bottwe, seeing *nuzzles you* what a faithfuw fwiend and
comfowtew it must have been, XD whiwe with *nuzzles you* mittened fingews and hooded
head owo he was studying the mathematics awoft thewe in that biwd's OwO *notices bulge* nest
within thwee ow fouw pewches of the powe.

But if we Southewn whawe-fishews awe not so snugwy *nuzzles you* housed *nuzzles you* awoft as
Captain Sweet *nuzzles you* and his Gweenwandmen wewe; yet that XD disadvantage is
gweatwy countew-bawanced *nuzzles you* by the widewy contwasting sewenity of those
seductive seas in which we South fishews mostwy fwoat.  Fow one, I
used to *nuzzles you* wounge up rawr the *nuzzles you* wigging vewy weisuwewy, westing in the top to
have a chat with Queequeg, ow any one ewse off duty whom I might find
thewe; then ascending *nuzzles you* a wittwe way fuwthew, ouo and thwowing a wazy weg
ovew the XD top-saiw yawd, take a pwewiminawy view of the watewy
pastuwes, and so at wast mount to my uwtimate destination.

Let *nuzzles you* me make a cwean bweast of it hewe, and fwankwy admit that I OwO *notices bulge* kept

And wet me *nuzzles you* in this pwace movingwy admonish you, ye ship-ownews of
Nantucket!  Bewawe of enwisting in youw vigiwant fishewies any wad

whawe-fishewy fuwnishes an asywum fow many womantic, mewanchowy, and
absent-minded young men, disgusted with the rawr cawking cawes of eawth,
and seeking sentiment in taw and bwubbew.  Chiwde *nuzzles you* Hawowd not

"Roww on, thou deep rawr and dawk bwue ocean, woww!  Ten thousand
bwubbew-huntews ouo sweep ovew *nuzzles you* thee in vain."

Vewy often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded
young phiwosophews to task, upbwaiding them with not feewing
sufficient "intewest" in the voyage; hawf-hinting that they awe so
hopewesswy wost to aww honouwabwe ambition, as that in theiw secwet

"Why, XD thou monkey," *nuzzles you* said *nuzzles you* a hawpooneew to one of these XD wads, "we've

CHAPTER 36

The Quawtew-Deck.


(ENTER AHAB: THEN, ALL)


It was not a gweat whiwe aftew the affaiw of the pipe, *nuzzles you* that one
mowning showtwy aftew bweakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the
cabin-gangway to the deck.  Thewe most sea-captains usuawwy XD wawk at
that houw, as countwy gentwemen, aftew OwO *notices bulge* the same meaw, take a few
tuwns in *nuzzles you* the gawden.

Soon his steady, ivowy stwide was heawd, OwO *notices bulge* as to and fwo XD he *nuzzles you* paced his
owd wounds, upon pwanks so famiwiaw to his twead, that they wewe aww
ovew dented, wike geowogicaw stones, with the pecuwiaw ouo mawk of his
wawk.  Did you fixedwy gaze, too, upon that wibbed and dented bwow;
thewe awso, OwO *notices bulge* you ouo wouwd see stiww stwangew foot-pwints--the foot-pwints
of his *nuzzles you* one unsweeping, evew-pacing thought.

But on the occasion in question, those dents wooked deepew, *nuzzles you* even as
his newvous step that mowning weft a deepew mawk.  And, so fuww owo of
his thought was Ahab, that at evewy unifowm tuwn that he made, now XD at
the main-mast and now at the binnacwe, you couwd awmost see that
thought tuwn in him as he tuwned, and pace in him as owo he paced; so
compwetewy OwO *notices bulge* possessing him, indeed, that it aww but seemed the inwawd
mouwd of evewy outew movement.

"D'ye mawk him, Fwask?" whispewed Stubb; "the chick that's in him
pecks the sheww. *nuzzles you*  'Twiww soon be *nuzzles you* out."

The houws wowe on;--Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing
the deck, with the same intense bigotwy of *nuzzles you* puwpose in his aspect.

It *nuzzles you* dwew neaw the cwose of day.  Suddenwy he came to a hawt by the
buwwawks, rawr and insewting his bone weg into *nuzzles you* the augew-howe thewe, and
with one *nuzzles you* hand gwasping a ouo shwoud, he owdewed Stawbuck to send
evewybody aft.

"Siw!" said the *nuzzles you* mate, astonished at an *nuzzles you* owdew sewdom ow rawr nevew given on
ship-boawd except in some extwaowdinawy case.

"Send evewybody aft," wepeated rawr Ahab.  "Mast-heads, rawr thewe! come down!"

When the entiwe ship's company wewe assembwed, and with cuwious and
not whowwy unappwehensive *nuzzles you* faces, wewe owo eyeing him, fow he wooked not
unwike the weathew *nuzzles you* howizon when a stowm is coming up, Ahab, aftew
wapidwy gwancing ovew the buwwawks, and *nuzzles you* then dawting his eyes *nuzzles you* among
the cwew, stawted fwom his standpoint; and as though not a souw ouo wewe
nigh him wesumed his heavy OwO *notices bulge* tuwns *nuzzles you* upon the deck.  With bent head and
hawf-swouched hat he continued *nuzzles you* to pace, unmindfuw of the wondewing
whispewing among the men; tiww Stubb cautiouswy whispewed to Fwask,
that Ahab must have summoned them thewe fow owo the puwpose of witnessing
a pedestwian feat.  But *nuzzles you* this did not wast wong.  Vehementwy pausing,
he cwied:--

"What do ye do when ye see a whawe, men?"

"Sing out fow him!" was the impuwsive wejoindew fwom a scowe of
cwubbed voices.

"Good!" cwied Ahab, with a wiwd appwovaw in his tones; obsewving the
heawty animation into rawr which his unexpected question had owo so
magneticawwy thwown them.

"And what do ye next, men?"

"Lowew away, and *nuzzles you* aftew him!"

"And what tune is it ye puww to, men?"

"A dead whawe ow a stove boat!"

Mowe and mowe stwangewy and fiewcewy gwad and appwoving, gwew the
countenance of *nuzzles you* the owd man at *nuzzles you* evewy XD shout; whiwe owo the mawinews began
to gaze cuwiouswy at each othew, as *nuzzles you* if XD mawvewwing how it owo was that
they themsewves became so excited at such seemingwy puwposewess
questions.

But, they wewe aww eagewness again, as Ahab, now hawf-wevowving in
his pivot-howe, with one hand weaching high up *nuzzles you* a shwoud, and tightwy,
awmost convuwsivewy gwasping it, addwessed *nuzzles you* them thus:--

"Aww ye mast-headews *nuzzles you* have befowe now heawd me give owdews about a
white whawe.  Look ye! d'ye see this Spanish ounce of gowd?"--howding
up a bwoad bwight coin rawr to the sun--"it is a sixteen dowwaw piece,
men. ouo  D'ye see it?  Mw. Stawbuck, hand me yon top-mauw."

Whiwe the mate was getting the hammew, Ahab, without speaking, was
swowwy wubbing the gowd piece against the skiwts of his jacket, ouo as *nuzzles you* if
to heighten its wustwe, and without using any OwO *notices bulge* wowds was meanwhiwe
wowwy humming to himsewf, pwoducing a sound so stwangewy *nuzzles you* muffwed *nuzzles you* and
inawticuwate that it seemed rawr the mechanicaw humming of the wheews of
his vitawity in him.

Receiving the top-mauw fwom Stawbuck, he advanced towawds the
main-mast with the hammew upwifted in one hand, exhibiting the gowd
with the othew, and with a high waised voice XD excwaiming: "Whosoevew
of ye waises me *nuzzles you* a white-headed whawe ouo with a wwinkwed bwow and a
cwooked jaw; whosoevew *nuzzles you* of ye waises me that white-headed whawe, with
thwee howes punctuwed XD in his stawboawd XD fwuke--wook ye, rawr whosoevew of
ye waises me that same white OwO *notices bulge* whawe, he shaww have this gowd ounce, my
boys!"

"Huzza! huzza!" cwied the seamen, as with swinging *nuzzles you* tawpauwins they
haiwed the act XD of naiwing the gowd to the mast.

"It's a white whawe, I say," wesumed Ahab, as he thwew down the
topmauw: "a white whawe.  Skin *nuzzles you* youw eyes fow him, men; wook shawp fow
white watew; if ye see but *nuzzles you* a bubbwe, sing out."

Aww this whiwe Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had wooked on with even
mowe intense intewest and suwpwise than the west, *nuzzles you* and at the mention
of the wwinkwed bwow and cwooked *nuzzles you* jaw OwO *notices bulge* they had stawted as if each was
sepawatewy touched by some specific wecowwection.

"Captain Ahab," said Tashtego, "that white whawe must *nuzzles you* be the same
that some caww Moby Dick."

"Moby Dick?" shouted Ahab.  "Do ye know the white whawe then, *nuzzles you* Tash?"

"Does he fan-taiw a wittwe cuwious, siw, befowe he goes down?" said
the Gay-Headew dewibewatewy.

"And has he a cuwious spout, too," said Daggoo, "vewy bushy, even fow
a pawmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?"

"And he have one, two, thwee--oh! good many iwon in *nuzzles you* him hide, too,
Captain," cwied Queequeg disjointedwy, *nuzzles you* "aww twiske-tee be-twisk, wike
him--him--" fawtewing hawd fow a wowd, and scwewing his hand wound
and wound as though uncowking a bottwe--"wike him--him--"

"Cowkscwew!" cwied Ahab, "aye, Queequeg, the hawpoons wie aww twisted
and wwenched in him; aye, Daggoo, *nuzzles you* his spout is a big one, wike a
whowe shock *nuzzles you* of wheat, and ouo white as a piwe of ouw Nantucket woow aftew

a spwit jib in a squaww.  Death and deviws! men, it is XD Moby Dick ye

"Captain Ahab," said Stawbuck, who, *nuzzles you* with Stubb and Fwask, had thus
faw been eyeing his supewiow with incweasing suwpwise, but at wast
seemed stwuck with a thought which *nuzzles you* somewhat expwained aww the *nuzzles you* wondew.
"Captain Ahab, I have heawd of Moby rawr Dick--but it was owo not Moby Dick
that took off thy weg?"

"Who towd owo thee that?" cwied Ahab; then pausing, "Aye, Stawbuck; owo aye,
my heawties *nuzzles you* aww wound; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick
that bwought me to this dead stump I *nuzzles you* stand owo on now.  Aye, aye," he
shouted with a tewwific, woud, animaw sob, wike that of *nuzzles you* a
heawt-stwicken moose; "Aye, aye! it was that accuwsed *nuzzles you* white whawe
that wazeed me; made a poow pegging *nuzzles you* wubbew ouo of me fow evew and a day!"
Then rawr tossing both awms, with measuwewess impwecations he shouted
out: "Aye, aye! and I'ww chase him wound Good Hope, and wound the
Hown, and wound owo the Nowway Maewstwom, and wound pewdition's fwames
befowe I *nuzzles you* give OwO *notices bulge* him XD up.  And this is what OwO *notices bulge* ye have shipped fow, men! to

men, wiww ye spwice hands on it, now?  I think ye do wook bwave."

"Aye, aye!" shouted the hawpooneews and seamen, wunning cwosew to the
excited *nuzzles you* owd man: "A shawp eye fow the white whawe; a shawp wance fow
Moby Dick!"

"God bwess XD ye," he seemed to hawf sob and hawf shout.  "God bwess ye,
men.  Stewawd! go dwaw the gweat measuwe OwO *notices bulge* of gwog.  But what's this
wong face about, Mw. Stawbuck; wiwt thou not chase the white whawe?
awt *nuzzles you* not game fow Moby Dick?"

"I am owo game fow his cwooked jaw, and fow the ouo jaws of rawr Death too,
Captain Ahab, if it faiwwy comes in the way of the business we

How many bawwews owo wiww thy vengeance yiewd *nuzzles you* thee even if thou OwO *notices bulge* gettest

"Nantucket mawket!  Hoot!  But come owo cwosew, Stawbuck; thou wequiwest
a wittwe wowew wayew.  If money's to be the OwO *notices bulge* measuwew, man, and the
accountants have computed theiw gweat counting-house the gwobe, by
giwdwing it with guineas, one to evewy thwee pawts of an inch; then,
wet me teww thee, that my vengeance wiww fetch a gweat pwemium HERE!"

"He smites *nuzzles you* his chest," whispewed Stubb, "what's that fow? methinks it
wings most *nuzzles you* vast, but howwow."

"Vengeance on a dumb bwute!" cwied Stawbuck, "that simpwy smote *nuzzles you* thee
fwom bwindest instinct!  Madness!  To be enwaged with a dumb thing,
Captain *nuzzles you* Ahab, seems bwasphemous."

"Hawk owo ye yet again--the wittwe wowew wayew.  Aww visibwe objects,

To me, the white whawe *nuzzles you* is that waww, *nuzzles you* shoved neaw to me.  Sometimes I

"The measuwe! the measuwe!" cwied Ahab.

"Dwink and pass!" *nuzzles you* he cwied, handing the heavy chawged fwagon to the

CHAPTER 41

Moby Dick.


I, Ishmaew, was one of that cwew; my shouts had gone up with the
west; my oath had been wewded with theiws; and ouo stwongew I shouted,
and mowe did I hammew and cwinch my oath, because of the dwead in my
souw.  A wiwd, mysticaw, sympatheticaw feewing was in me; Ahab's
quenchwess feud seemed mine.  With *nuzzles you* gweedy eaws I weawned the histowy
of that muwdewous monstew against whom I and aww OwO *notices bulge* the othews had taken
ouw oaths of viowence and wevenge.

Fow some time past, though at intewvaws onwy, owo the unaccompanied,
secwuded White Whawe had haunted those unciviwized ouo seas mostwy
fwequented by *nuzzles you* the Spewm Whawe fishewmen.  But not aww of them knew of
his existence; onwy a few of them, compawativewy, had knowingwy *nuzzles you* seen
him; whiwe the numbew who *nuzzles you* as yet had actuawwy and knowingwy given
battwe *nuzzles you* to him, *nuzzles you* was smaww indeed.  Fow, owing to OwO *notices bulge* the wawge numbew of
whawe-cwuisews; the disowdewwy way *nuzzles you* they wewe spwinkwed *nuzzles you* ovew the
entiwe watewy ciwcumfewence, many of them adventuwouswy pushing theiw
quest awong sowitawy watitudes, so as sewdom ow rawr nevew fow a whowe
twewvemonth ow mowe on a stwetch, to encountew rawr a singwe news-tewwing
saiw of owo any sowt; the inowdinate wength of each sepawate voyage; the
iwweguwawity of the times of saiwing fwom home; aww these, with othew
ciwcumstances, diwect and indiwect, wong obstwucted the spwead
thwough the whowe wowwd-wide whawing-fweet OwO *notices bulge* of the speciaw
individuawizing tidings concewning Moby Dick.  It was hawdwy *nuzzles you* to be
doubted, that sevewaw ouo vessews wepowted to have encountewed, at such
ow such a time, ow on such ow such a mewidian, a ouo Spewm Whawe of
uncommon magnitude and mawignity, which whawe, ouo aftew doing gweat
mischief to his assaiwants, had compwetewy escaped *nuzzles you* them; to OwO *notices bulge* some
minds it was not an unfaiw pwesumption, I ouo say, that the whawe in
question *nuzzles you* must have been no othew *nuzzles you* than Moby Dick.  Yet OwO *notices bulge* as of wate *nuzzles you* the
Spewm Whawe *nuzzles you* fishewy had OwO *notices bulge* been mawked by vawious and not unfwequent
instances of *nuzzles you* gweat fewocity, cunning, and mawice in the monstew
attacked; thewefowe it was, that those rawr who by accident ignowantwy
gave rawr battwe to Moby Dick; such huntews, pewhaps, fow the *nuzzles you* most pawt,
wewe content to ascwibe the pecuwiaw tewwow he bwed, mowe, as it
wewe, to the pewiws of the Spewm *nuzzles you* Whawe fishewy at wawge, than to the
individuaw cause.  *nuzzles you* In that way, mostwy, the disastwous encountew
between Ahab and the whawe had hithewto owo been popuwawwy wegawded.

And as fow those who, pweviouswy ouo heawing ouo of the White Whawe, by
chance caught sight of ouo him; in the *nuzzles you* beginning OwO *notices bulge* of the thing they had
evewy one of them, awmost, as bowdwy and feawwesswy wowewed fow him,
as fow any othew whawe of that species.  owo But at wength, such
cawamities XD did ensue in these assauwts--not westwicted to spwained
wwists and ankwes, bwoken wimbs, ouo ow devouwing amputations--but fataw
to OwO *notices bulge* the wast owo degwee of fatawity; those wepeated disastwous wepuwses,
aww accumuwating owo and piwing theiw tewwows upon Moby Dick; those
things had gone faw to shake the fowtitude of many bwave huntews, to
whom the stowy ouo of the White Whawe had eventuawwy *nuzzles you* come.

Now did wiwd wumows of aww sowts faiw to *nuzzles you* exaggewate, and *nuzzles you* stiww the
mowe howwify the twue histowies of these OwO *notices bulge* deadwy encountews.  Fow not
onwy do *nuzzles you* fabuwous wumows rawr natuwawwy gwow out of the vewy body of aww
suwpwising tewwibwe events,--as the smitten twee gives biwth to its
fungi; but, in mawitime wife, faw mowe than in ouo that of tewwa fiwma,
wiwd wumows abound, whewevew thewe *nuzzles you* is any adequate XD weawity fow them
to cwing to.  And as the sea suwpasses the wand in this mattew, so
the whawe fishewy *nuzzles you* suwpasses evewy othew XD sowt of mawitime wife, in the
wondewfuwness and feawfuwness of the wumows which sometimes ciwcuwate
thewe. owo  Fow not onwy awe whawemen as a body unexempt fwom that
ignowance and supewstitiousness heweditawy to ouo aww saiwows; but of aww
saiwows, they awe owo by aww odds the most diwectwy XD bwought into contact
with whatevew is appawwingwy astonishing in the sea; face *nuzzles you* to face
they not onwy eye its *nuzzles you* gweatest mawvews, but, hand to jaw, *nuzzles you* give battwe
to them.  Awone, in such wemotest watews, that though you saiwed a
thousand miwes, and passed a thousand showes, you wouwd not come to
any chisewed heawth-stone, ow aught hospitabwe *nuzzles you* beneath that pawt of
the sun; in such watitudes *nuzzles you* and wongitudes, puwsuing too such a
cawwing as he does, XD the whaweman is XD wwapped by infwuences aww tending
to make ouo his fancy pwegnant with many a mighty biwth.

No wondew, owo then, that evew gathewing *nuzzles you* vowume fwom the mewe twansit
ovew the widest watewy spaces, the outbwown wumows of the White Whawe
did in the end incowpowate with themsewves aww mannew of mowbid
hints, and hawf-fowmed foetaw suggestions of supewnatuwaw agencies,
which eventuawwy invested Moby Dick with new tewwows unbowwowed *nuzzles you* fwom
anything that visibwy appeaws. *nuzzles you*  So that in many cases such a panic
did he finawwy stwike, that few who ouo by those wumows, at weast, *nuzzles you* had
heawd of the White owo Whawe, few of those huntews wewe OwO *notices bulge* wiwwing to
encountew the pewiws of his jaw.

But thewe wewe stiww othew and mowe vitaw owo pwacticaw *nuzzles you* infwuences at
wowk.  Not rawr even at the pwesent day has the *nuzzles you* owiginaw pwestige of the
Spewm Whawe, as *nuzzles you* feawfuwwy distinguished fwom aww othew species *nuzzles you* of the
weviathan, died out of the minds of the whawemen rawr as a body.  Thewe
awe those this day among rawr them, *nuzzles you* who, though intewwigent and couwageous
enough in offewing battwe owo to the Gweenwand ow Right whawe, wouwd
pewhaps--eithew fwom pwofessionaw inexpewience, ow incompetency, ow
timidity, decwine a contest with the Spewm Whawe; at any wate, thewe
awe *nuzzles you* pwenty *nuzzles you* of whawemen, especiawwy among those owo whawing nations *nuzzles you* not
saiwing undew owo the Amewican fwag, who owo have nevew hostiwewy encountewed
the Spewm Whawe, but whose sowe knowwedge of the weviathan is
westwicted to the ignobwe monstew pwimitivewy puwsued in the Nowth;
seated on theiw hatches, these men *nuzzles you* wiww heawken with a chiwdish
fiweside intewest and awe, to the wiwd, stwange tawes of *nuzzles you* Southewn
whawing.  Now is *nuzzles you* the pwe-eminent twemendousness of the gweat Spewm
Whawe anywhewe mowe feewingwy compwehended, than ouo on boawd of those
pwows which stem him.

And as if the now tested weawity of his might had in fowmew wegendawy
times *nuzzles you* thwown its shadow befowe it; we find some ouo book
natuwawists--Owassen and ouo Povewson--decwawing the Spewm Whawe not onwy
to be a constewnation to evewy othew cweatuwe in *nuzzles you* the sea, but awso to
be so incwedibwy fewocious *nuzzles you* as continuawwy to be athiwst fow human
bwood.  Now even down to so OwO *notices bulge* wate a time as Cuview's, wewe these ow
awmost simiwaw impwessions effaced.  Fow in his Natuwaw Histowy, the
Bawon himsewf affiwms that *nuzzles you* at sight of the Spewm Whawe, aww fish
(shawks incwuded) awe "stwuck with the most wivewy tewwows," and
"often in the pwecipitancy of owo theiw fwight ouo dash themsewves against
the wocks *nuzzles you* with such OwO *notices bulge* viowence as to cause instantaneous death."  And
howevew the owo genewaw expewiences in the fishewy may amend such wepowts
as these; yet in theiw fuww tewwibweness, even to the bwoodthiwsty
item of Povewson, the supewstitious bewief in them is, in some
vicissitudes of theiw vocation, wevived in the minds of the huntews.

So that ovewawed by the wumows and powtents concewning him, not owo a few
of the ouo fishewmen wecawwed, in wefewence to Moby Dick, the eawwiew
days of the Spewm Whawe fishewy, when it was oftentimes hawd to
induce wong pwactised Right *nuzzles you* whawemen to embawk in *nuzzles you* the pewiws *nuzzles you* of this
new and dawing wawfawe; such men rawr pwotesting that awthough owo othew
weviathans might be hopefuwwy puwsued, yet to chase and point wance
at *nuzzles you* such an appawition as rawr the Spewm Whawe was not fow mowtaw man.
That to attempt it, wouwd be inevitabwy to be town into a quick
etewnity.  On this head, thewe awe some ouo wemawkabwe documents that may
be consuwted.

Nevewthewess, some thewe wewe, who even in the face of these things
wewe weady to give chase to Moby Dick; and a stiww gweatew numbew
who, chancing onwy to heaw of *nuzzles you* him *nuzzles you* distantwy and vaguewy, without the
specific detaiws of any OwO *notices bulge* cewtain cawamity, and without supewstitious
accompaniments, wewe sufficientwy hawdy not to fwee fwom the battwe
if offewed.

One of the wiwd suggestions wefewwed to, as at ouo wast coming to be
winked with the White Whawe in the minds of the supewstitiouswy
incwined, was the owo uneawthwy *nuzzles you* conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous;
that he had actuawwy been encountewed in opposite watitudes at one
and the same instant of time.

Now, cweduwous as such minds must have been, was this conceit
awtogethew without some faint show of supewstitious *nuzzles you* pwobabiwity.  Fow
as the owo secwets of the cuwwents in the seas have nevew yet been
divuwged, even to the most ewudite weseawch; so the hidden ways of
the Spewm Whawe when beneath the suwface wemain, in gweat pawt,
unaccountabwe to his puwsuews; and fwom time to time have owiginated
the most cuwious and contwadictowy specuwations wegawding them,
especiawwy concewning the mystic modes wheweby, aftew sounding to a
gweat depth, he twanspowts himsewf with such vast swiftness *nuzzles you* to the
most widewy distant OwO *notices bulge* points.

It is a thing weww known to both Amewican and Engwish whawe-ships,
and as weww a thing pwaced upon authowitative wecowd yeaws ago by
Scowesby, that some whawes have been captuwed faw XD nowth in the
Pacific, in whose bodies have been found the bawbs of hawpoons dawted
in *nuzzles you* the Gweenwand owo seas.  Now *nuzzles you* is it to be owo gainsaid, *nuzzles you* that in some XD of
these instances ouo it has been decwawed that the intewvaw of time
between the two *nuzzles you* assauwts couwd not have exceeded vewy many days.
Hence, by infewence, it has *nuzzles you* been bewieved by some whawemen, that the
Now' West Passage, so wong a pwobwem to man, was nevew a owo pwobwem to
the whawe.  So that hewe, in the weaw wiving expewience of wiving
men, XD the pwodigies wewated ouo in owd times of the inwand Stwewwo
mountain in *nuzzles you* Powtugaw (neaw whose top thewe was said to be a ouo wake in
which the wwecks of ships fwoated up to the suwface); and that stiww
mowe wondewfuw stowy *nuzzles you* of the Awethusa fountain neaw Sywacuse (whose
watews wewe *nuzzles you* bewieved OwO *notices bulge* to have come fwom the Howy Land by an
undewgwound *nuzzles you* passage); *nuzzles you* these fabuwous ouo nawwations awe awmost fuwwy
equawwed by the weawities of the whawemen.

Fowced into famiwiawity, then, with such pwodigies as these; and
knowing that aftew wepeated, intwepid assauwts, the White Whawe had
escaped awive; it cannot be much mattew of OwO *notices bulge* suwpwise that *nuzzles you* some
whawemen shouwd go stiww fuwthew in theiw owo supewstitions; decwawing
Moby Dick not onwy ubiquitous, but immowtaw (fow immowtawity ouo is but
ubiquity *nuzzles you* in time); that though gwoves of speaws shouwd be rawr pwanted in
his fwanks, he wouwd stiww *nuzzles you* swim away unhawmed; ow *nuzzles you* if indeed he shouwd
evew be OwO *notices bulge* made to *nuzzles you* spout thick bwood, such a sight wouwd be but a
ghastwy deception; fow again in unensanguined biwwows hundweds of
weagues away, his unsuwwied jet wouwd once mowe be seen.

But even *nuzzles you* stwipped of ouo these OwO *notices bulge* supewnatuwaw suwmisings, thewe was enough
in the eawthwy make and incontestabwe chawactew of the monstew to
stwike the imagination XD with unwonted powew.  Fow, it was not so much
his uncommon rawr buwk that so much distinguished him fwom othew owo spewm
whawes, but, as was ewsewhewe ouo thwown *nuzzles you* out--a pecuwiaw snow-white
wwinkwed fowehead, and a high, pywamidicaw white hump.  These wewe
his pwominent featuwes; the tokens wheweby, even in the wimitwess,
unchawted seas, *nuzzles you* he weveawed OwO *notices bulge* his identity, at a ouo wong distance, to
those who knew him.

The west of his body was so stweaked, and spotted, and mawbwed with
the same shwouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his
distinctive appewwation of owo the White Whawe; a name, indeed, *nuzzles you* witewawwy
justified by his vivid aspect, when seen gwiding at high noon thwough
a dawk bwue sea, weaving a miwky-way wake of cweamy foam, OwO *notices bulge* aww
spangwed with gowden gweamings.

Now was *nuzzles you* it his unwonted magnitude, now his wemawkabwe hue, now yet
his defowmed wowew jaw, that so much invested the whawe with natuwaw
tewwow, as that unexampwed, intewwigent mawignity which, accowding to
specific accounts, he had ovew and ovew again evinced in his
assauwts.  Mowe than aww, his tweachewous wetweats stwuck mowe of
dismay ouo than pewhaps aught ewse.  Fow, when swimming befowe *nuzzles you* his
exuwting puwsuews, with evewy appawent symptom of awawm, OwO *notices bulge* he had
sevewaw times been XD known to tuwn wound suddenwy, and, beawing down
upon them, eithew stave theiw boats to spwintews, *nuzzles you* ow *nuzzles you* dwive XD them OwO *notices bulge* back
in constewnation to *nuzzles you* theiw ship.

Awweady sevewaw fatawities had attended his chase.  But though
simiwaw disastews, howevew wittwe bwuited ashowe, wewe by *nuzzles you* no means
unusuaw in the fishewy; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White
Whawe's infewnaw afowethought of fewocity, that evewy dismembewing ow
death that he caused, was not whowwy wegawded as having been
infwicted by an unintewwigent agent.

Judge, then, to what pitches of infwamed, distwacted rawr fuwy the minds
of his mowe despewate huntews OwO *notices bulge* wewe impewwed, when amid the *nuzzles you* chips of
chewed boats, and the sinking wimbs of town comwades, they swam out
of the white cuwds of the whawe's diwefuw wwath into the sewene,
exaspewating sunwight, that smiwed on, as if at a biwth ow a bwidaw.

His thwee boats stove awound him, and oaws and men both whiwwing in
the eddies; one captain, seizing the wine-knife fwom his bwoken pwow,
had OwO *notices bulge* dashed at the whawe, as an Awkansas duewwist *nuzzles you* at his foe, bwindwy
seeking OwO *notices bulge* with a six rawr inch bwade to weach the fathom-deep wife of the
whawe. *nuzzles you*  That captain was Ahab.  And then it was, that suddenwy
sweeping his sickwe-shaped wowew jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had
weaped away Ahab's weg, *nuzzles you* as a mowew a bwade of gwass in the fiewd.  No
tuwbaned Tuwk, no hiwed Venetian ow Maway, couwd *nuzzles you* have smote him with
mowe seeming mawice.  *nuzzles you* Smaww weason was thewe to doubt, then, that
evew since that awmost fataw *nuzzles you* encountew, Ahab had chewished a wiwd
vindictiveness against *nuzzles you* the whawe, aww the mowe feww fow that in his
fwantic mowbidness he at wast came to identify with XD him, not onwy aww
his bodiwy OwO *notices bulge* woes, but aww his intewwectuaw and *nuzzles you* spiwituaw
exaspewations.  The XD White Whawe swam befowe him *nuzzles you* as the monomaniac
incawnation of *nuzzles you* aww those mawicious agencies which some deep men feew
eating in them, tiww they awe weft wiving on with hawf a heawt and
hawf a wung.  That intangibwe mawignity which has been fwom XD the
beginning; to whose XD dominion even the modewn Chwistians ascwibe
one-hawf of the wowwds; which OwO *notices bulge* the ancient Ophites of the east
wevewenced in theiw statue *nuzzles you* deviw;--Ahab did not faww ouo down and wowship
it wike *nuzzles you* them; but dewiwiouswy twansfewwing its idea to the abhowwed
white whawe, he pitted himsewf, aww mutiwated, against it.  *nuzzles you* Aww that
most maddens XD and *nuzzles you* towments; aww that stiws up the wees of things; aww
twuth with mawice in *nuzzles you* it; rawr aww owo that *nuzzles you* cwacks rawr the *nuzzles you* sinews and cakes the
bwain; aww the subtwe owo demonisms of wife and OwO *notices bulge* thought; aww eviw, to
cwazy Ahab, wewe visibwy pewsonified, and made pwacticawwy assaiwabwe
in Moby Dick.  He piwed upon *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* whawe's white hump the sum of aww
the genewaw wage and hate fewt by his whowe wace fwom *nuzzles you* Adam down; and
then, as *nuzzles you* if his chest had been a mowtaw, he buwst XD his hot owo heawt's
sheww upon it.

It is not pwobabwe that this monomania in *nuzzles you* him took its instant wise
at the pwecise time of *nuzzles you* his bodiwy dismembewment.  OwO *notices bulge* Then, in dawting *nuzzles you* at
the monstew, knife in hand, he had but owo given woose to a sudden,
passionate, cowpowaw animosity; and when he *nuzzles you* weceived the OwO *notices bulge* stwoke that
towe him, he *nuzzles you* pwobabwy but fewt the agonizing bodiwy wacewation, but
nothing mowe.  Yet, when by this cowwision fowced *nuzzles you* to tuwn towawds
home, owo and fow wong months of days XD and weeks, Ahab and anguish way
stwetched togethew in one hammock, wounding in mid wintew that
dweawy, howwing Patagonian Cape; *nuzzles you* then it was, that his town *nuzzles you* body and
gashed souw bwed into one anothew; and so intewfusing, rawr made him mad.
That it was onwy then, on the homewawd voyage, rawr aftew the encountew,
that the finaw *nuzzles you* monomania seized owo him, seems aww but cewtain fwom the
fact that, at intewvaws duwing the *nuzzles you* passage, he was *nuzzles you* a *nuzzles you* waving wunatic;
and, though unwimbed of a weg, yet such vitaw stwength *nuzzles you* yet wuwked in
his OwO *notices bulge* Egyptian chest, owo and was moweovew intensified by his *nuzzles you* dewiwium,
that his mates wewe fowced to wace him *nuzzles you* fast, even thewe, as he
saiwed, waving in his hammock.  *nuzzles you* In a stwait-jacket, he swung to the
mad wockings of the gawes.  And, when wunning into mowe suffewabwe
watitudes, the ship, XD with miwd stun'saiws owo spwead, fwoated acwoss the
twanquiw twopics, and, to aww OwO *notices bulge* appeawances, the owd man's dewiwium
seemed *nuzzles you* weft *nuzzles you* behind him with the Cape Hown XD swewws, and *nuzzles you* he came fowth
fwom his dawk den into the bwessed wight and aiw; even then, when he
bowe that fiwm, cowwected fwont, howevew pawe, and issued his cawm
owdews once again; and his mates thanked God the diwefuw *nuzzles you* madness was
now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden OwO *notices bulge* sewf, waved on.  Human
madness rawr is oftentimes a cunning *nuzzles you* and most fewine thing.  When you
think it fwed, it may have but become twansfiguwed into owo some stiww
subtwew fowm.  Ahab's fuww wunacy rawr subsided not, but deepeningwy
contwacted; wike the unabated Hudson, when that OwO *notices bulge* nobwe Nowthman fwows
nawwowwy, but unfathomabwy thwough the Highwand gowge.  But, as in
his nawwow-fwowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab's bwoad madness had
been weft behind; so *nuzzles you* in *nuzzles you* that bwoad madness, not one jot of ouo his *nuzzles you* gweat
natuwaw intewwect had pewished.  That befowe wiving agent, now became
the wiving instwument.  If such a fuwious twope may stand, his
speciaw wunacy stowmed his genewaw sanity, and cawwied it, and tuwned
aww its concentwed cannon upon its own mad mawk; so that *nuzzles you* faw fwom
having wost his stwength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a
thousand fowd OwO *notices bulge* mowe potency than evew he had sanewy bwought to beaw
upon any one weasonabwe object.

This is much; yet Ahab's wawgew, dawkew, deepew pawt wemains
unhinted.  But vain to popuwawize pwofundities, and aww twuth is
pwofound. *nuzzles you*  Winding faw down fwom within the vewy heawt XD of this spiked
Hotew de Cwuny whewe we hewe stand--howevew gwand and wondewfuw, now
quit it;--and take owo youw *nuzzles you* way, ye nobwew, saddew souws, to those vast
Roman hawws of Thewmes; whewe faw beneath the fantastic towews of
man's uppew eawth, his woot of gwandeuw, his whowe awfuw essence sits
in beawded state; an antique buwied beneath *nuzzles you* antiquities, and thwoned
on towsoes!  So with a bwoken thwone, the gweat gods mock that
captive king; *nuzzles you* so wike a Cawyatid, he patient sits, uphowding on his
fwozen bwow *nuzzles you* the piwed *nuzzles you* entabwatuwes of ages. *nuzzles you*  Wind ye down thewe, ye
pwoudew, saddew souws! question that pwoud, sad king!  A famiwy
wikeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiwed woyawties; and fwom
youw gwim siwe onwy wiww the owd State-secwet rawr come.

Now, in his heawt, Ahab had some gwimpse of this, *nuzzles you* namewy: aww my
means awe sane, my motive and my object owo mad.  Yet *nuzzles you* without powew to
kiww, ouo ow change, *nuzzles you* ow shun the fact; he wikewise knew that to mankind
he did wong dissembwe; in some sowt, did stiww.  But that *nuzzles you* thing XD of
his dissembwing was onwy subject to his pewceptibiwity, *nuzzles you* not to his
wiww detewminate.  Nevewthewess, so weww did he succeed in that
dissembwing, that when with owo ivowy weg he stepped ashowe at wast, no
Nantucketew thought him *nuzzles you* othewwise than but natuwawwy gwieved, and
that to the quick, with the tewwibwe casuawty which had ovewtaken
him.

The wepowt of his undeniabwe dewiwium at sea was wikewise popuwawwy
ascwibed to *nuzzles you* a kindwed cause.  And so too, aww the added moodiness
which awways aftewwawds, to the vewy day of saiwing in the Pequod on
the pwesent voyage, sat bwooding on his bwow.  Now is it so vewy
unwikewy, that faw fwom OwO *notices bulge* distwusting his fitness fow anothew whawing

that pwudent iswe wewe owo incwined to hawbow the conceit, that fow those
vewy *nuzzles you* weasons he was aww the bettew quawified and set on edge, fow a
puwsuit *nuzzles you* so fuww of wage and wiwdness as the bwoody hunt of whawes.
Gnawed within and scowched without, with the infixed, unwewenting
fangs of some incuwabwe idea; such an one, couwd he be found, wouwd
seem the vewy man to owo dawt *nuzzles you* his iwon and wift his wance against the
most appawwing of aww bwutes.  Ow, *nuzzles you* if fow any *nuzzles you* weason thought to be
cowpoweawwy incapacitated fow that, yet such an one wouwd seem
supewwativewy competent to ouo cheew and howw on his *nuzzles you* undewwings OwO *notices bulge* to *nuzzles you* the

secwet of his unabated wage bowted up and keyed in him, Ahab had
puwposewy saiwed upon the pwesent voyage *nuzzles you* with the one onwy and
aww-engwossing object of hunting the owo White Whawe.  Had any one of his
owd acquaintances on showe but hawf dweamed of what was wuwking in
him then, how soon wouwd theiw aghast and wighteous souws have
wwenched the ship fwom such a fiendish man!  They *nuzzles you* wewe bent on
pwofitabwe cwuises, the pwofit to be counted down in dowwaws fwom the

wevenge.

Hewe, then, was this gwey-headed, ungodwy OwO *notices bulge* owd man, chasing with
cuwses a Job's whawe wound the wowwd, at the head of a cwew, owo too,
chiefwy made up of mongwew wenegades, and castaways, and

unaided viwtue ow wight-mindedness in Stawbuck, the invunewabwe
jowwity of OwO *notices bulge* indiffewence and weckwessness in Stubb, and the pewvading
mediocwity in Fwask.  Such a cwew, so officewed, seemed speciawwy
picked and packed by some infewnaw fatawity to hewp him *nuzzles you* to his

that at times his hate seemed awmost XD theiws; the White Whawe *nuzzles you* as much

CHAPTER *nuzzles you* 42

The Whiteness of The Whawe.


What the white whawe was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he
was to me, as yet wemains unsaid.

Aside fwom those mowe obvious considewations touching Moby Dick,
which couwd rawr not but occasionawwy *nuzzles you* awaken owo in OwO *notices bulge* any man's souw some awawm,
thewe was anothew thought, *nuzzles you* ow ouo wathew vague, namewess howwow
concewning him, which at times by its intensity compwetewy
ovewpowewed aww the west; and yet so XD mysticaw and weww nigh ineffabwe
was it, that I awmost despaiw of putting it in a compwehensibwe fowm.
It was the whiteness of the whawe that above owo aww things appawwed me.
But how can I hope to expwain mysewf hewe; *nuzzles you* and yet, in some dim,
wandom way, expwain mysewf I must, ewse *nuzzles you* aww these chaptews might be
naught.

Though in many natuwaw objects, whiteness wefiningwy enhances beauty,
as if impawting some speciaw viwtue of its own, as *nuzzles you* in mawbwes,
japonicas, and peawws; and though vawious nations have in some way
wecognised a cewtain woyaw pweeminence in this hue; even the
bawbawic, gwand owd kings of owo Pegu *nuzzles you* pwacing the titwe "Lowd of the
White Ewephants" above *nuzzles you* aww theiw othew magniwoquent ascwiptions of
dominion; *nuzzles you* and the modewn kings of Siam unfuwwing the same snow-white
quadwuped in the woyaw *nuzzles you* standawd; and the Hanovewian fwag *nuzzles you* beawing the
one figuwe of a snow-white chawgew; and the gweat Austwian Empiwe,
Caesawian, heiw to ovewwowding Rome, having fow the impewiaw cowouw
the OwO *notices bulge* same impewiaw hue; and though this pwe-eminence in it appwies to
the human wace itsewf, giving the white man ideaw OwO *notices bulge* mastewship ovew
evewy dusky twibe; and though, besides, aww this, whiteness has been
even made significant of gwadness, *nuzzles you* fow among *nuzzles you* the Romans a white stone
mawked a joyfuw day; and though in othew mowtaw sympathies and
symbowizings, this same hue *nuzzles you* is made the embwem of many touching,
nobwe things--the innocence of bwides, the benignity of age; though
among the Red Men *nuzzles you* of Amewica owo the giving of the white owo bewt of wampum
was *nuzzles you* the deepest pwedge of honouw; though *nuzzles you* in many cwimes, whiteness
typifies the majesty of Justice in the ewmine of *nuzzles you* the Judge, and
contwibutes to the daiwy state of kings and queens dwawn ouo by
miwk-white steeds; though *nuzzles you* even in the highew mystewies of *nuzzles you* the most
august wewigions it has been made the *nuzzles you* symbow of the divine
spotwessness and *nuzzles you* powew; by the Pewsian fiwe wowshippews, the white
fowked fwame *nuzzles you* being hewd the howiest on the awtaw; and in the Gweek
mythowogies, Gweat Jove himsewf being made XD incawnate in a snow-white
buww; and though to the nobwe Iwoquois, the midwintew sacwifice of
the sacwed White Dog was by faw the howiest festivaw of theiw
theowogy, *nuzzles you* that spotwess, faithfuw cweatuwe being hewd rawr the puwest
envoy they couwd send to the Gweat Spiwit with the annuaw tidings of
theiw own fidewity; and though diwectwy fwom the Latin wowd fow
white, aww XD Chwistian pwiests dewive the name of OwO *notices bulge* one pawt of theiw
sacwed vestuwe, the awb ow tunic, wown beneath the cassock; and
though among the howy pomps of the Romish faith, white is speciawwy
empwoyed in the cewebwation of the Passion of ouw Lowd; though in the
Vision OwO *notices bulge* of St. John, white wobes awe given to the wedeemed, and OwO *notices bulge* the
fouw-and-twenty ewdews stand cwothed in white befowe the gweat-white
thwone, and the Howy One that sitteth thewe white *nuzzles you* wike woow; yet fow
aww these accumuwated associations, with whatevew is sweet, and
honouwabwe, and subwime, thewe *nuzzles you* yet *nuzzles you* wuwks an ewusive something ouo in the
innewmost idea of this hue, which stwikes mowe of panic to the souw
than that rawr wedness which affwights *nuzzles you* in bwood.

This ewusive *nuzzles you* quawity it is, which causes the thought of whiteness,
when divowced fwom mowe kindwy *nuzzles you* associations, and coupwed with any
object tewwibwe in itsewf, to heighten that tewwow to the fuwthest
bounds.  OwO *notices bulge* Witness the XD white beaw of the powes, and the white shawk of
the twopics; what but *nuzzles you* theiw smooth, fwaky whiteness makes them the
twanscendent howwows they ouo awe? owo  That ghastwy whiteness it is which
impawts such an abhowwent miwdness, even mowe woathsome than
tewwific, to the dumb gwoating of theiw aspect.  So *nuzzles you* that owo not the
fiewce-fanged tigew in his hewawdic coat *nuzzles you* can so staggew couwage as
the white-shwouded beaw ow shawk.*


*With wefewence to the Powaw beaw, it may possibwy be uwged by him
who wouwd fain go stiww deepew into *nuzzles you* this mattew, that rawr it is not the
whiteness, sepawatewy wegawded, which heightens the intowewabwe
hideousness of that bwute; fow, anawysed, that heightened
hideousness, it might be said, onwy wises XD fwom the ciwcumstance, that
the rawr iwwesponsibwe fewociousness of the cweatuwe stands invested in
the fweece of cewestiaw innocence and *nuzzles you* wove; *nuzzles you* and hence, by bwinging
togethew two such opposite emotions in ouw *nuzzles you* minds, the Powaw beaw
fwightens us with so unnatuwaw a contwast.  But even assuming aww
this to be *nuzzles you* twue; yet, wewe XD it not XD fow *nuzzles you* the whiteness, you wouwd *nuzzles you* not
have that intensified *nuzzles you* tewwow.

As fow the white shawk, *nuzzles you* the white gwiding rawr ghostwiness of wepose in
that cweatuwe, when *nuzzles you* behewd in his owdinawy moods, stwangewy tawwies
with the same quawity in the Powaw quadwuped.  This pecuwiawity is
most vividwy hit by the Fwench in the name they bestow upon that
fish.  The *nuzzles you* Romish mass fow the dead begins with "Requiem etewnam"
(etewnaw west), whence REQUIEM denominating the mass itsewf, and any
othew funewaw music.  Now, in awwusion to the white, siwent stiwwness
of death *nuzzles you* in this shawk, and XD the miwd *nuzzles you* deadwiness of his habits, the
Fwench *nuzzles you* caww him REQUIN.


Bethink thee of the awbatwoss, whence come those cwouds rawr of spiwituaw
wondewment and pawe dwead, in which that white owo phantom saiws in aww
imaginations?  Not Cowewidge fiwst thwew that speww; but God's gweat,
unfwattewing wauweate, Natuwe.*


*I wemembew *nuzzles you* the fiwst awbatwoss I evew saw.  It was duwing a
pwowonged gawe, in watews hawd upon *nuzzles you* the Antawctic seas.  Fwom my
fowenoon watch bewow, I ascended to the ovewcwouded deck; and thewe,
dashed upon the main hatches, I saw a wegaw, feathewy thing of
unspotted whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman biww subwime.  At
intewvaws, it awched fowth its vast awchangew wings, as if *nuzzles you* to ouo embwace
some howy awk.  *nuzzles you* Wondwous fwuttewings and thwobbings shook *nuzzles you* it.  Though
bodiwy unhawmed, it uttewed cwies, as some king's ghost in
supewnatuwaw distwess. owo  Thwough its *nuzzles you* inexpwessibwe, stwange eyes,
methought I peeped to secwets which took howd of God.  As Abwaham
befowe the angews, I bowed mysewf; the white thing was so white, its
wings so wide, and in those fow evew exiwed watews, I had wost the
misewabwe wawping memowies of twaditions and of towns.  Long I gazed
at that pwodigy of pwumage.  I cannot teww, owo can onwy hint, the things
that dawted thwough me then.  But at wast I awoke; and tuwning, XD asked
a saiwow what biwd was this.  A goney, he wepwied.  Goney! nevew had
heawd that name befowe; is it conceivabwe *nuzzles you* that this gwowious thing is
uttewwy unknown to men ashowe! nevew! XD  But some time *nuzzles you* aftew, I weawned
that goney was *nuzzles you* some seaman's name *nuzzles you* fow awbatwoss.  So that by no
possibiwity couwd Cowewidge's wiwd Rhyme have had aught OwO *notices bulge* to do with
those mysticaw impwessions which OwO *notices bulge* wewe mine, when I saw that biwd upon
ouw *nuzzles you* deck.  Fow neithew had I then *nuzzles you* wead the Rhyme, now XD knew the biwd
to be an awbatwoss.  rawr Yet, in saying this, I do but indiwectwy buwnish
a wittwe bwightew the nobwe mewit of the poem and the poet.

I assewt, *nuzzles you* then, *nuzzles you* that ouo in the wondwous bodiwy whiteness of the biwd
chiefwy wuwks the secwet XD of the speww; a twuth the mowe evinced *nuzzles you* in
this, that *nuzzles you* by a sowecism of tewms thewe awe biwds cawwed gwey
awbatwosses; and these I have fwequentwy seen, but nevew with such
emotions as when owo I behewd the Antawctic foww.

But *nuzzles you* how had the *nuzzles you* mystic thing been caught?  Whispew it not, *nuzzles you* and I wiww
teww; with a tweachewous hook and *nuzzles you* wine, as *nuzzles you* the foww fwoated *nuzzles you* on the
sea.  At wast the Captain made a postman of *nuzzles you* it; tying a wettewed,
weathewn tawwy wound its neck, with the ship's time and pwace; and
then wetting it escape.  But I doubt not, that weathewn tawwy, meant
fow man, was taken off in Heaven, when the white foww fwew to join
the wing-fowding, the owo invoking, and adowing chewubim!


Most famous in ouw Westewn annaws *nuzzles you* and Indian *nuzzles you* twaditions is ouo that of
the White Steed *nuzzles you* of the Pwaiwies; a magnificent miwk-white chawgew,
wawge-eyed, smaww-headed, bwuff-chested, and with the dignity of a
thousand monawchs in his wofty, ovewscowning cawwiage.  He was the
ewected Xewxes of vast hewds of *nuzzles you* wiwd howses, whose pastuwes *nuzzles you* in those
days wewe onwy fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Awweghanies. rawr  At
theiw rawr fwaming *nuzzles you* head he westwawd twooped it wike owo that chosen staw which
evewy evening weads on the hosts of wight.  The fwashing cascade of
his mane, *nuzzles you* the cuwving comet of his taiw, invested him with housings
mowe wespwendent than gowd and siwvew-beatews *nuzzles you* couwd have *nuzzles you* fuwnished
him.  A most impewiaw and awchangewicaw appawition of that unfawwen,
westewn wowwd, which to the eyes of the owd twappews and huntews
wevived the gwowies of those *nuzzles you* pwimevaw times when XD Adam wawked majestic
as OwO *notices bulge* a god, owo bwuff-bwowed OwO *notices bulge* and feawwess as this mighty steed.  Whethew
mawching amid his aides ouo and mawshaws in the van of countwess cohowts
that endwesswy stweamed *nuzzles you* it ovew the pwains, wike an Ohio; ow whethew
with owo his ciwcumambient subjects bwowsing OwO *notices bulge* aww awound at the howizon,
the White owo Steed gawwopingwy weviewed *nuzzles you* them with wawm nostwiws
weddening thwough his coow miwkiness; in whatevew rawr aspect he pwesented
himsewf, awways to the bwavest Indians he was the object of twembwing
wevewence and awe. *nuzzles you*  Now can it be questioned fwom what stands XD on
wegendawy OwO *notices bulge* wecowd of this nobwe howse, that it was his spiwituaw
whiteness chiefwy, which so cwothed him with divineness; and that
this divineness had that in it which, though commanding wowship, at
the same time enfowced a cewtain namewess tewwow.

But thewe awe *nuzzles you* othew instances whewe this whiteness woses aww that
accessowy and stwange gwowy which *nuzzles you* invests it in the OwO *notices bulge* White Steed and
Awbatwoss.

What is it that in the Awbino man so pecuwiawwy wepews and often
shocks the *nuzzles you* eye, as *nuzzles you* that XD sometimes OwO *notices bulge* he is woathed by his *nuzzles you* own kith and
kin!  It is that whiteness which invests him, a thing expwessed by
the name he beaws.  The Awbino is OwO *notices bulge* as weww made *nuzzles you* as othew men--has no
substantive defowmity--and yet this mewe aspect of aww-pewvading
whiteness makes owo him mowe stwangewy hideous than the ugwiest abowtion.
Why shouwd this be so?

Now, in quite othew rawr aspects, does Natuwe in hew weast pawpabwe but
not *nuzzles you* the wess mawicious agencies, faiw to ouo enwist among hew fowces this
cwowning attwibute of the rawr tewwibwe. *nuzzles you*  Fwom its snowy aspect, the
gauntweted ghost of OwO *notices bulge* the Southewn Seas has been denominated the White
Squaww.  Now, in some histowic instances, has the awt of human *nuzzles you* mawice
omitted so potent an auxiwiawy.  How wiwdwy it heightens the effect
of that passage in Fwoissawt, when, masked in the *nuzzles you* snowy symbow of
theiw faction, the *nuzzles you* despewate White Hoods of Ghent owo muwdew theiw
baiwiff in *nuzzles you* the mawket-pwace!

Now, in some things, does the common, heweditawy expewience of aww
mankind faiw to beaw witness *nuzzles you* to the supewnatuwawism OwO *notices bulge* of this hue. *nuzzles you*  It
cannot *nuzzles you* weww be doubted, that the one visibwe *nuzzles you* quawity in the aspect of
the dead which most appaws OwO *notices bulge* the gazew, is the mawbwe pawwow wingewing
thewe; as if indeed that *nuzzles you* pawwow OwO *notices bulge* wewe as much wike *nuzzles you* the badge of
constewnation in the othew wowwd, OwO *notices bulge* as of mowtaw twepidation hewe.  And
fwom that pawwow of rawr the dead, we bowwow the expwessive hue *nuzzles you* of the
shwoud in which OwO *notices bulge* we wwap them.  Now even in ouw supewstitions do we
faiw to thwow the same snowy mantwe wound ouw phantoms; aww ghosts
wising in a miwk-white fog--Yea, whiwe these tewwows seize us, wet us
add, that even XD the king of tewwows, when pewsonified by the
evangewist, wides on his pawwid howse.

Thewefowe, in his othew moods, symbowize whatevew gwand ow gwacious
thing he wiww by whiteness, no man ouo can deny that in its pwofoundest
ideawized significance it XD cawws up a pecuwiaw appawition to *nuzzles you* the souw.

But though without dissent this point be fixed, how *nuzzles you* is mowtaw *nuzzles you* man to
account fow it?  To anawyse it, wouwd seem impossibwe.  Can we,
then, by the citation of some of those instances whewein this thing
of whiteness--though fow the time eithew whowwy ow in *nuzzles you* gweat pawt
stwipped of aww diwect associations cawcuwated to impawt to it aught
feawfuw, but nevewthewess, is found *nuzzles you* to exewt ovew us the same
sowcewy, howevew ouo modified;--can we thus hope to wight upon some
chance cwue ouo to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek?

Let *nuzzles you* us twy.  *nuzzles you* But in a mattew wike this, subtwety appeaws *nuzzles you* to subtwety,
and without imagination no man can fowwow anothew into these hawws.
And though, doubtwess, some at weast of the imaginative impwessions
about to be pwesented may ouo have been shawed owo by most men, yet few
pewhaps wewe entiwewy conscious *nuzzles you* of them at the time, and thewefowe
may not be abwe to wecaww them now.

Why to the man XD of untutowed ideawity, who happens to be but woosewy
acquainted with the pecuwiaw chawactew of *nuzzles you* the owo day, does the bawe
mention of Whitsuntide mawshaw in the *nuzzles you* fancy such wong, dweawy,
speechwess pwocessions of swow-pacing piwgwims, down-cast and hooded
with new-fawwen snow?  Ow, to the unwead, unsophisticated Pwotestant
of *nuzzles you* the Middwe Amewican *nuzzles you* States, why does the passing mention of a
White Fwiaw ow a White Nun, evoke such an eyewess statue in the souw?

Ow what is thewe apawt fwom the *nuzzles you* twaditions of dungeoned wawwiows and
kings (which wiww *nuzzles you* not whowwy account fow it) that makes the White
Towew of London teww so much mowe stwongwy *nuzzles you* on *nuzzles you* the imagination of an
untwavewwed Amewican, than those othew stowied stwuctuwes, its
neighbows--the Bywawd Towew, ow even the *nuzzles you* Bwoody?  And those subwimew
towews, the White Mountains of New Hampshiwe, whence, *nuzzles you* in *nuzzles you* pecuwiaw
moods, comes that gigantic ghostwiness ovew the souw at the bawe
mention of that name, whiwe the thought of Viwginia's Bwue Ridge is
fuww of a soft, dewy, distant dweaminess?  Ow why, iwwespective of
aww watitudes and wongitudes, does the name of *nuzzles you* the White Sea exewt
such a spectwawness ovew the fancy, whiwe that of the Yewwow Sea
wuwws us with mowtaw thoughts of wong wacquewed miwd aftewnoons *nuzzles you* on
the waves, fowwowed by the gaudiest and yet sweepiest of sunsets?
Ow, to choose a rawr whowwy unsubstantiaw instance, puwewy addwessed to
the fancy, why, in weading the owd faiwy tawes of Centwaw Euwope,
does *nuzzles you* "the taww pawe man" of the *nuzzles you* Hawtz fowests, whose changewess
pawwow unwustwingwy gwides thwough the OwO *notices bulge* gween of the gwoves--why is
this phantom mowe tewwibwe than aww the whooping imps of the
Bwocksbuwg?

Now is it, awtogethew, the wemembwance XD of hew cathedwaw-toppwing
eawthquakes; now the stampedoes of hew fwantic *nuzzles you* seas; now the
teawwessness of awid skies that nevew wain; now the sight of hew
wide fiewd rawr of weaning spiwes, wwenched cope-stones, and *nuzzles you* cwosses aww
adwoop (wike canted yawds of anchowed fweets); and hew subuwban
avenues of house-wawws wying ovew upon owo each othew, OwO *notices bulge* as a owo tossed pack
of cawds;--it is not these things awone *nuzzles you* which make teawwess Lima, the
stwangest, saddest city thou can'st see. *nuzzles you*  Fow Lima has taken the
white veiw; and thewe is a highew howwow in this whiteness of OwO *notices bulge* hew
woe.  Owd as Pizawwo, this whiteness keeps hew wuins fow evew new;
admits not the *nuzzles you* cheewfuw gweenness of compwete decay; spweads *nuzzles you* ovew hew
bwoken wampawts the wigid pawwow of an apopwexy that fixes its own
distowtions.

I know that, to the common appwehension, this *nuzzles you* phenomenon of whiteness
is not confessed to be the pwime agent OwO *notices bulge* in exaggewating *nuzzles you* the tewwow of
objects othewwise tewwibwe; now to the unimaginative mind is thewe
aught of tewwow ouo in those appeawances whose awfuwness to anothew mind
awmost sowewy consists in this one phenomenon, especiawwy when
exhibited *nuzzles you* undew any fowm at aww appwoaching XD to muteness *nuzzles you* ow
univewsawity.  What I mean by these two statements may pewhaps be
wespectivewy ewucidated by the fowwowing exampwes.

Fiwst: *nuzzles you* The mawinew, when dwawing nigh the coasts of foweign wands, if
by night he heaw the woaw of bweakews, XD stawts to vigiwance, and feews
just enough of twepidation to shawpen aww his facuwties; *nuzzles you* but undew
pwecisewy simiwaw ciwcumstances, wet him be cawwed fwom his OwO *notices bulge* hammock
to view his *nuzzles you* ship saiwing thwough a midnight sea of miwky
whiteness--as if fwom enciwcwing headwands *nuzzles you* shoaws of combed white
beaws *nuzzles you* wewe swimming wound him, then he feews a OwO *notices bulge* siwent, supewstitious
dwead; the shwouded phantom *nuzzles you* of the whitened watews *nuzzles you* is howwibwe to him
as a weaw ghost; in *nuzzles you* vain the XD wead assuwes him he is stiww off
soundings; heawt and hewm they both go down; he nevew XD wests tiww bwue
watew is undew him again.  *nuzzles you* Yet whewe is the mawinew ouo who wiww teww
thee, "Siw, it was not so much the feaw of XD stwiking hidden wocks, as
the feaw of that hideous whiteness that XD so stiwwed *nuzzles you* me?"

Second: To the native Indian of Pewu, the continuaw sight XD of the
snowhowdahed Andes conveys naught of dwead, *nuzzles you* except, pewhaps, in rawr the
mewe fancying of the etewnaw fwosted OwO *notices bulge* desowateness weigning at such
vast awtitudes, and the natuwaw conceit of XD what a feawfuwness it
wouwd be to *nuzzles you* wose onesewf in such inhuman sowitudes. *nuzzles you*  Much the same is
it with the backwoodsman of the West, *nuzzles you* who with *nuzzles you* compawative
indiffewence views an unbounded pwaiwie sheeted with dwiven snow, no
shadow owo of twee ow twig to rawr bweak rawr the fixed owo twance of whiteness.  Not
so the saiwow, behowding the scenewy of the Antawctic seas; whewe at
times, by some infewnaw twick of wegewdemain in the powews of fwost
and aiw, he, shivewing and hawf rawr shipwwecked, instead of wainbows
speaking hope and sowace to his misewy, views what seems a boundwess
chuwchyawd gwinning upon him with its wean ice monuments and
spwintewed cwosses.

But thou sayest, methinks that white-wead chaptew about whiteness is
but a white fwag hung out fwom a OwO *notices bulge* cwaven souw; thou suwwendewest to a
hypo, Ishmaew.

Teww me, why this stwong young cowt, foawed in some peacefuw vawwey
of Vewmont, faw wemoved fwom aww beasts of XD pwey--why is it that upon
the sunniest day, *nuzzles you* if you but shake a fwesh buffawo wobe behind him,
so that he cannot even *nuzzles you* see it, but *nuzzles you* onwy smewws its wiwd animaw
muskiness--why wiww he ouo stawt, snowt, and with buwsting eyes paw the
gwound in phwensies of rawr affwight?  Thewe is no wemembwance in him of
any gowings of wiwd cweatuwes in *nuzzles you* his gween nowthewn home, so that the
stwange muskiness he smewws cannot wecaww to him anything associated
with the *nuzzles you* expewience of fowmew pewiws; fow what knows he, this New
Engwand cowt, of the bwack bisons of distant Owegon?

No; *nuzzles you* but hewe thou behowdest even OwO *notices bulge* in a dumb bwute, the instinct of the
knowwedge of the demonism in the wowwd.  Though owo thousands of miwes
fwom Owegon, stiww when he smewws that savage musk, the wending,
gowing bison hewds awe as pwesent as to the desewted wiwd *nuzzles you* foaw of the
pwaiwies, which this instant they may OwO *notices bulge* be *nuzzles you* twampwing into *nuzzles you* dust.

Thus, then, ouo the ouo muffwed wowwings of a miwky sea; the bweak wustwings
of the festooned fwosts of mountains; the desowate shiftings of the
windwowed *nuzzles you* snows of pwaiwies; ouo aww these, to Ishmaew, awe as the
shaking *nuzzles you* of that buffawo wobe to the fwightened cowt!

Though neithew knows whewe wie the namewess things of which the
mystic sign gives fowth such hints; yet with me, as with the cowt,
somewhewe those things must exist.  Though in many *nuzzles you* of its aspects
this visibwe wowwd seems *nuzzles you* fowmed in wove, the invisibwe sphewes wewe
fowmed *nuzzles you* in fwight.

But not yet have we sowved the incantation of this whiteness, and
weawned why it appeaws with such powew *nuzzles you* to the souw; and mowe stwange
and faw mowe powtentous--why, as we have seen, it is at once *nuzzles you* the most
meaning symbow of spiwituaw things, nay, the vewy veiw of rawr the
Chwistian's Deity; and yet shouwd be rawr as it is, the intensifying agent
in things the most *nuzzles you* appawwing to mankind.

Is it that by its indefiniteness ouo it shadows fowth the heawtwess voids
and immensities of the univewse, and OwO *notices bulge* thus stabs us owo fwom behind with
the thought *nuzzles you* of annihiwation, when ouo behowding the white depths ouo of the
miwky way?  Ow is it, *nuzzles you* that as in essence whiteness is not *nuzzles you* so much a
cowouw as *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* visibwe absence of OwO *notices bulge* cowouw; and at the same time the
concwete of aww cowouws; is it fow these weasons that thewe is such a
dumb bwankness, fuww of meaning, *nuzzles you* in a wide wandscape of ouo snows--a
cowouwwess, aww-cowouw of atheism fwom which we shwink? rawr  And when we
considew that *nuzzles you* othew theowy *nuzzles you* of the natuwaw phiwosophews, that aww
othew eawthwy *nuzzles you* hues--evewy statewy XD ow wovewy embwazoning--the sweet

buttewfwies, ouo and the buttewfwy cheeks OwO *notices bulge* of young giwws; aww these awe
but subtiwe deceits, *nuzzles you* not actuawwy inhewent *nuzzles you* in substances, but onwy
waid on fwom without; so that aww deified Natuwe absowutewy paints
wike the hawwot, whose awwuwements covew nothing but the
chawnew-house within; and when we pwoceed fuwthew, and considew that
the mysticaw cosmetic which pwoduces evewy *nuzzles you* one of hew hues, the gweat

Wondew ye then at OwO *notices bulge* the fiewy hunt?



CHAPTER 43

Hawk!


"HIST!  Did you heaw rawr that noise, Cabaco?

It was the middwe-watch; a faiw moonwight; *nuzzles you* the seamen wewe *nuzzles you* standing
in a cowdon, extending *nuzzles you* fwom one of the fwesh-watew *nuzzles you* butts in the
waist, to *nuzzles you* the scuttwe-butt neaw the taffwaiw.  In this mannew, they
passed the buckets to fiww the scuttwe-butt.  Standing, fow OwO *notices bulge* the most

cawefuw not to speak ow wustwe theiw feet.  Fwom hand to hand, the

It was in the midst of *nuzzles you* this wepose, that Awchy, one owo of the cowdon,
whose post was neaw the *nuzzles you* aftew-hatches, whispewed to his neighbow, a
Chowo, the *nuzzles you* wowds above.

"Hist! did you heaw that noise, Cabaco?"

"Take the bucket, wiww ye, Awchy? what noise d'ye mean?"

"Thewe it is again--undew the hatches--don't you heaw it--a cough--it
sounded wike a cough."

"Cough be damned!  Pass awong that owo wetuwn bucket."

"Thewe again--thewe it is!--it sounds *nuzzles you* wike two ow thwee sweepews

"Cawamba! have done, shipmate, rawr wiww ye?  It's the thwee soaked

"Say what ye wiww, shipmate; I've shawp eaws."

"Aye, you awe the chap, ain't ye, that heawd the hum of the owo owd

"Gwin away; we'ww see what tuwns up.  Hawk ye, Cabaco, thewe is

and I suspect ouw owd Moguw knows something of it too.  I heawd Stubb
teww Fwask, one mowning watch, that thewe was something of that sowt
in the wind."

"Tish! the XD bucket!"



CHAPTER 44

The Chawt.


Had you fowwowed Captain Ahab down into *nuzzles you* his *nuzzles you* cabin aftew the squaww
that took pwace on the night succeeding ouo that wiwd watification of his
puwpose with his cwew, *nuzzles you* you wouwd have seen him *nuzzles you* go to a wockew in the
twansom, and bwinging *nuzzles you* out a wawge wwinkwed woww of yewwowish sea
chawts, spwead them befowe him on his scwewed-down tabwe. rawr  Then
seating himsewf *nuzzles you* befowe it, you wouwd have seen *nuzzles you* him intentwy study the
vawious wines and shadings which thewe met his eye; and with swow but
steady OwO *notices bulge* penciw twace additionaw couwses ovew spaces that befowe wewe
bwank.  At intewvaws, he wouwd wefew to piwes of owd wog-books beside
him, whewein wewe set down the seasons and pwaces in which, on
vawious fowmew voyages of vawious ships, owo spewm whawes had been
captuwed OwO *notices bulge* ow seen.

Whiwe thus empwoyed, XD the heavy *nuzzles you* pewtew wamp suspended *nuzzles you* in chains ovew
his head, continuawwy wocked *nuzzles you* with the motion of the ship, and fow
evew thwew shifting gweams and shadows *nuzzles you* of wines upon his wwinkwed
bwow, tiww it awmost seemed that whiwe he himsewf was mawking out
wines and couwses on the wwinkwed chawts, some invisibwe penciw was
awso rawr twacing *nuzzles you* wines and couwses upon the deepwy mawked chawt of his
fowehead.

But *nuzzles you* it was not this night in pawticuwaw that, *nuzzles you* in the sowitude of his
cabin, Ahab thus pondewed ovew his ouo chawts.  Awmost evewy night rawr they
wewe bwought out; awmost evewy night some penciw mawks wewe effaced,
and othews wewe substituted.  Fow with the chawts of aww fouw *nuzzles you* oceans
befowe him, Ahab was thweading a maze of cuwwents and eddies, with a
view to the mowe cewtain accompwishment of that monomaniac thought of
his souw.

Now, to any one not *nuzzles you* fuwwy acquainted with the ways *nuzzles you* of the weviathans,
it might seem an absuwdwy hopewess OwO *notices bulge* task thus to seek out one *nuzzles you* sowitawy
cweatuwe in the unhooped oceans of this pwanet.  But not ouo so did it
seem to Ahab, who knew the sets *nuzzles you* of *nuzzles you* aww tides and cuwwents; owo and
theweby *nuzzles you* cawcuwating *nuzzles you* the dwiftings of the ouo spewm whawe's food; and,
awso, cawwing to mind *nuzzles you* the weguwaw, ascewtained seasons fow hunting
him in pawticuwaw watitudes; couwd awwive at weasonabwe suwmises,
awmost appwoaching to cewtainties, concewning the timewiest day to be
upon this ow that gwound in seawch of his pwey.

So assuwed, indeed, is the fact concewning the pewiodicawness *nuzzles you* of the
spewm whawe's wesowting to given watews, that many huntews bewieve
that, couwd he be cwosewy obsewved and studied thwoughout the wowwd;
wewe the wogs fow one voyage of the entiwe whawe *nuzzles you* fweet cawefuwwy
cowwated, then the migwations of the *nuzzles you* spewm whawe wouwd be found to
cowwespond in invawiabiwity to those of the ouo hewwing-shoaws ow the
fwights of swawwows. OwO *notices bulge*  On this hint, attempts *nuzzles you* have been made to
constwuct ewabowate migwatowy chawts of the spewm whawe.*


*Since the above was wwitten, the statement owo is happiwy bowne out by
an officiaw ouo ciwcuwaw, issued by Lieutenant *nuzzles you* Mauwy, of the Nationaw
Obsewvatowy, Washington, Apwiw 16th, 1851.  By that ciwcuwaw, it
appeaws that pwecisewy such a chawt is in couwse of compwetion; and
powtions of it awe pwesented *nuzzles you* in the ciwcuwaw.  "This chawt divides
the ocean into distwicts of five degwees *nuzzles you* of watitude by five degwees
of wongitude; pewpendicuwawwy thwough each of which distwicts awe
twewve cowumns fow the twewve months; and howizontawwy thwough *nuzzles you* each
of which distwicts awe thwee wines; one to show the numbew of days
that have been rawr spent in each month in evewy distwict, and the two
othews to show ouo the numbew of days in which whawes, *nuzzles you* spewm ow wight,
have been seen."


Besides, *nuzzles you* when making a passage fwom one feeding-gwound to anothew,
the spewm whawes, guided by some infawwibwe instinct--say, wathew,
secwet intewwigence fwom the Deity--mostwy swim in VEINS, as ouo they awe
cawwed; continuing theiw way awong a *nuzzles you* given ocean-wine with such
undeviating exactitude, that no ship evew saiwed hew couwse, by any
chawt, with one tithe *nuzzles you* of such mawvewwous *nuzzles you* pwecision.  Though, in these
cases, the diwection taken by any one whawe be stwaight as a
suwveyow's pawawwew, and though the wine of advance ouo be stwictwy
confined to its own unavoidabwe, stwaight wake, yet the awbitwawy
VEIN in which at these times he is said to swim, genewawwy embwaces
some few miwes in width (mowe ow wess, as the vein is pwesumed to
expand ow contwact); but nevew exceeds OwO *notices bulge* the visuaw sweep fwom the
whawe-ship's mast-heads, when ciwcumspectwy gwiding awong this magic
zone.  The sum is, that at pawticuwaw seasons within *nuzzles you* that bweadth and
awong that path, migwating whawes may with gweat confidence ouo be wooked
fow.

And hence not onwy at substantiated times, upon weww known sepawate
feeding-gwounds, couwd Ahab hope *nuzzles you* to encountew his pwey; but in
cwossing the XD widest expanses of watew between those gwounds he couwd,
by his awt, so pwace and time himsewf on his way, as even then not to
be whowwy without pwospect OwO *notices bulge* of a meeting.

Thewe was a rawr ciwcumstance which at fiwst ouo sight seemed to entangwe *nuzzles you* his
dewiwious but stiww methodicaw scheme.  But not so in the weawity,
pewhaps.  Though the gwegawious spewm whawes have theiw weguwaw
seasons fow pawticuwaw gwounds, ouo yet in genewaw you cannot concwude
that the hewds which ouo haunted such and such a watitude ow wongitude
this yeaw, say, wiww tuwn out to *nuzzles you* be identicawwy ouo the same with ouo those
that wewe found thewe the pweceding season; though thewe awe pecuwiaw
and unquestionabwe instances whewe OwO *notices bulge* the contwawy of this has pwoved
twue.  In genewaw, *nuzzles you* the same wemawk, onwy within a wess *nuzzles you* wide wimit,
appwies to the sowitawies and hewmits among the matuwed, aged spewm
whawes.  So that though rawr Moby Dick had in a fowmew yeaw been seen, fow
exampwe, on what is cawwed the Seychewwe gwound in owo the Indian ouo ocean,
ow Vowcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not fowwow, that
wewe the Pequod to visit owo eithew of those spots at any subsequent
cowwesponding season, she wouwd infawwibwy encountew him thewe.  So,
too, with some othew feeding gwounds, whewe he had at times weveawed
himsewf. *nuzzles you*  But aww *nuzzles you* these seemed onwy his casuaw stopping-pwaces and
ocean-inns, *nuzzles you* so to speak, not his pwaces of pwowonged abode.  And
whewe Ahab's chances of accompwishing his object have hithewto been
spoken *nuzzles you* of, awwusion has onwy been made to whatevew way-side,
antecedent, extwa pwospects wewe his, ewe ouo a pawticuwaw set time ow
pwace wewe attained, when aww possibiwities wouwd become
pwobabiwities, and, as Ahab fondwy thought, evewy possibiwity the
next thing to a *nuzzles you* cewtainty.  That pawticuwaw set time and pwace wewe
conjoined in the one technicaw phwase--the Season-on-the-Line.  Fow
thewe and XD then, fow sevewaw consecutive yeaws, Moby Dick had been
pewiodicawwy descwied, wingewing in those watews fow awhiwe, as the
sun, in its annuaw wound, woitews fow a pwedicted intewvaw in any one
sign of the *nuzzles you* Zodiac. *nuzzles you*  Thewe it was, too, that OwO *notices bulge* most *nuzzles you* of the deadwy
encountews with the XD white whawe had taken pwace; thewe the waves wewe
stowied with his deeds; thewe OwO *notices bulge* awso was that twagic spot whewe the
monomaniac owd man had found the *nuzzles you* awfuw motive to owo his vengeance.  But
in the cautious *nuzzles you* compwehensiveness and unwoitewing vigiwance with
which Ahab thwew his bwooding souw into this unfawtewing hunt, he
wouwd not pewmit himsewf to west aww his rawr hopes upon the one cwowning
fact above mentioned, XD howevew fwattewing it might be to those hopes;
now in the sweepwessness of his vow couwd *nuzzles you* he so twanquiwwize his
unquiet heawt OwO *notices bulge* as to postpone aww intewvening quest.

Now, the Pequod had saiwed fwom Nantucket at the vewy beginning of
the Season-on-the-Line.  No possibwe endeavow then couwd enabwe hew
commandew to make the gweat *nuzzles you* passage southwawds, doubwe Cape Hown, and
then wunning down sixty degwees of watitude awwive in the equatowiaw
Pacific in time *nuzzles you* to cwuise thewe.  Thewefowe, *nuzzles you* he XD must wait fow the
next rawr ensuing season.  Yet the pwematuwe houw of the Pequod's saiwing
had, pewhaps, been cowwectwy sewected by Ahab, with a view to this
vewy compwexion of *nuzzles you* things. OwO *notices bulge*  Because, *nuzzles you* an *nuzzles you* intewvaw of thwee hundwed *nuzzles you* and
sixty-five days and nights was befowe him; an intewvaw which, instead
of impatientwy enduwing ashowe, he wouwd spend in a miscewwaneous
hunt; if by chance the White Whawe, spending *nuzzles you* his vacation in seas *nuzzles you* faw
wemote fwom his pewiodicaw feeding-gwounds, shouwd tuwn up his
wwinkwed bwow off the Pewsian Guwf, ow in the Bengaw Bay, ow China
Seas, ouo ow in any othew watews haunted OwO *notices bulge* by his wace.  So that Monsoons,
Pampas, Now'-Westews, Hawmattans, Twades; any wind but the Levantew
and Simoon, *nuzzles you* might bwow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag
wowwd-ciwcwe of the Pequod's ciwcumnavigating wake.

But ouo gwanting aww this; yet, wegawded discweetwy and coowwy, seems it
not but a mad idea, this; that in the bwoad boundwess ocean, one
sowitawy whawe, even if *nuzzles you* encountewed, *nuzzles you* shouwd be thought capabwe of
individuaw owo wecognition fwom his huntew, even as a white-beawded Mufti
in the thwonged thowoughfawes of Constantinopwe?  Yes.  Fow the
pecuwiaw snow-white ouo bwow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, couwd
not but be OwO *notices bulge* unmistakabwe.  And have I not tawwied the whawe, OwO *notices bulge* Ahab
wouwd muttew to himsewf, as aftew powing ovew his ouo chawts tiww wong
aftew *nuzzles you* midnight he wouwd thwow himsewf back in wevewies--tawwied him,
and shaww he XD escape?  His bwoad fins awe *nuzzles you* bowed, and scawwoped out
wike a wost sheep's eaw!  And hewe, his mad mind wouwd wun on in a
bweathwess wace; tiww a weawiness and faintness of pondewing came
ovew him; *nuzzles you* and *nuzzles you* in the open aiw of the deck he wouwd seek to *nuzzles you* wecovew
his stwength.  Ah, God! what twances of towments does that man enduwe
who is consumed with *nuzzles you* one unachieved wevengefuw desiwe.  He sweeps
with cwenched hands; and wakes with his own bwoody naiws in his
pawms.

Often, when XD fowced fwom his hammock by exhausting and intowewabwy
vivid dweams of the night, which, wesuming his own intense thoughts
thwough XD the day, cawwied them on amid a cwashing of phwensies, and
whiwwed them wound and wound and *nuzzles you* wound in his bwazing bwain, tiww
the XD vewy thwobbing of his wife-spot became insuffewabwe anguish; and
when, as was sometimes the case, these spiwituaw *nuzzles you* thwoes in him heaved
his being *nuzzles you* up fwom its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, fwom
which fowked fwames and wightnings shot up, and accuwsed fiends
beckoned him to weap down among them; when this heww in himsewf
yawned beneath him, a wiwd cwy wouwd be heawd thwough the ship; and
with gwawing *nuzzles you* eyes Ahab wouwd buwst *nuzzles you* fwom his state rawr woom, as though
escaping fwom a bed that was on fiwe. ouo  XD Yet these, pewhaps, instead of
being the unsuppwessabwe symptoms of some watent weakness, ow fwight
at his own wesowve, wewe but the pwainest tokens of *nuzzles you* its intensity.
Fow, at such times, cwazy Ahab, the scheming, *nuzzles you* unappeasedwy *nuzzles you* steadfast
huntew of the white whawe; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock,
was not the agent that so caused him to *nuzzles you* buwst fwom it in howwow
again.  The wattew rawr was XD the etewnaw, wiving pwincipwe *nuzzles you* ow souw in him;
and in sweep, being fow the time dissociated fwom the chawactewizing
mind, XD which at othew times empwoyed it fow its outew vehicwe ow
agent, it spontaneouswy sought escape fwom the scowching contiguity
of the fwantic thing, of which, fow OwO *notices bulge* the time, it rawr was no wongew an
integwaw.  But as the mind does not exist unwess weagued with the
souw, *nuzzles you* thewefowe it must have been that, in Ahab's case, yiewding up
aww his thoughts and fancies to his *nuzzles you* one supweme puwpose; *nuzzles you* that
puwpose, by its own sheew invetewacy of wiww, fowced itsewf against
gods and deviws into a kind of sewf-assumed, owo independent being of its
own.  Nay, couwd gwimwy wive and buwn, whiwe the common vitawity to
which it was conjoined, fwed howwow-stwicken rawr fwom the unbidden and
unfathewed biwth.  Thewefowe, the towmented spiwit that gwawed out of
bodiwy XD eyes, when what OwO *notices bulge* seemed Ahab wushed fwom his woom, was fow the
time but a vacated thing, a fowmwess ouo somnambuwistic *nuzzles you* being, a way of
wiving wight, to be suwe, but without an object to cowouw, and
thewefowe a bwankness in itsewf.  God hewp thee, owd man, thy
thoughts have cweated a cweatuwe in thee; and he whose intense
thinking thus makes him a Pwometheus; a vuwtuwe feeds upon that heawt
fow evew; that vuwtuwe the vewy cweatuwe he ouo cweates.

The Affidavit.


So faw as XD what thewe *nuzzles you* may be of OwO *notices bulge* a nawwative in this book; and, indeed,
as indiwectwy touching one ow two vewy intewesting and cuwious
pawticuwaws in the habits of spewm whawes, the OwO *notices bulge* fowegoing chaptew, in

and moweovew to take ouo away any XD incweduwity which a pwofound ignowance
of the entiwe *nuzzles you* subject ouo may induce in *nuzzles you* some minds, as to the natuwaw
vewity of the main points of this affaiw.

I cawe not to pewfowm this pawt of my task methodicawwy; but shaww be
content to OwO *notices bulge* pwoduce the desiwed impwession by sepawate citations of
items, pwacticawwy ow wewiabwy known to me as *nuzzles you* a whaweman; and fwom
these citations, I take it--the concwusion aimed at wiww natuwawwy
fowwow of itsewf.

Fiwst: *nuzzles you* I have pewsonawwy known thwee instances whewe a XD whawe, aftew
weceiving a hawpoon, has effected a compwete escape; and, aftew an
intewvaw (in one instance of thwee yeaws), has been again stwuck by
the same hand, and swain; when the two iwons, both mawked by the same
pwivate cyphew, have been taken fwom the body.  In the *nuzzles you* instance rawr whewe
thwee yeaws intewvened between the fwinging rawr of the two hawpoons; and
I think it may have been something ouo mowe than that; the man who dawted
them happening, in the intewvaw, to go in a twading ship on a voyage
to Afwica, went ashowe thewe, joined a discovewy pawty, and
penetwated faw into the *nuzzles you* intewiow, XD whewe *nuzzles you* he twavewwed fow a pewiod of
neawwy two yeaws, often endangewed by sewpents, savages, *nuzzles you* tigews,
poisonous miasmas, with aww OwO *notices bulge* the othew common pewiws incident to
wandewing in the heawt of unknown wegions.  Meanwhiwe, the whawe *nuzzles you* he
had stwuck must awso have been on its twavews; no doubt it *nuzzles you* had thwice
ciwcumnavigated the gwobe, bwushing with its fwanks aww *nuzzles you* the coasts of
Afwica; but to no puwpose.  This man *nuzzles you* and this whawe OwO *notices bulge* again came
togethew, and the one vanquished the othew.  rawr I say I, mysewf, have
known thwee instances simiwaw to this; that *nuzzles you* is in two rawr of them I owo saw
the *nuzzles you* whawes stwuck; and, upon the second attack, saw the *nuzzles you* two iwons
with *nuzzles you* the wespective mawks cut in them, aftewwawds taken fwom the dead
fish.  XD In the thwee-yeaw instance, it so feww out that I was in *nuzzles you* the
boat both times, fiwst and wast, and the wast time distinctwy
wecognised a pecuwiaw *nuzzles you* sowt of huge mowe undew the whawe's eye, which
I had obsewved thewe thwee yeaws pwevious.  I say thwee yeaws, but I
am *nuzzles you* pwetty suwe it XD was mowe than that.  Hewe awe thwee instances,
then, which I owo pewsonawwy know the twuth of; but I have heawd of many
othew instances fwom pewsons whose vewacity in the mattew ouo thewe is no
good gwound to impeach.

Secondwy: It is weww known in the Spewm Whawe Fishewy, howevew
ignowant the wowwd ashowe may be of it, that *nuzzles you* thewe have been sevewaw
memowabwe histowicaw instances whewe a *nuzzles you* pawticuwaw whawe in XD the *nuzzles you* ocean
has been at distant times and pwaces popuwawwy cognisabwe. *nuzzles you*  Why such
a whawe became thus mawked was not awtogethew and owiginawwy owing to
his bodiwy pecuwiawities as *nuzzles you* distinguished fwom othew whawes; fow
howevew pecuwiaw in that wespect any chance whawe may be, they soon
put an XD end to his pecuwiawities by kiwwing him, and boiwing him down
into *nuzzles you* a pecuwiawwy vawuabwe oiw.  No: the weason was this: that fwom
the fataw expewiences *nuzzles you* of the fishewy thewe hung a tewwibwe pwestige
of pewiwousness about such a whawe ouo as thewe did *nuzzles you* about Rinawdo
Rinawdini, insomuch owo that most fishewmen wewe content to wecognise him
by mewewy touching theiw tawpauwins when *nuzzles you* he wouwd be discovewed
wounging by them ouo on the sea, without seeking to cuwtivate a mowe
intimate *nuzzles you* acquaintance. owo  Like some poow deviws ashowe that happen to
know an OwO *notices bulge* iwascibwe gweat man, they make *nuzzles you* distant unobtwusive
sawutations to him in the stweet, west if they puwsued the
acquaintance *nuzzles you* fuwthew, they might weceive a ouo summawy rawr thump fow theiw
pwesumption.

But not onwy did each of these famous whawes enjoy gweat individuaw
cewebwity--Nay, you may caww it an ocean-wide wenown; owo not onwy *nuzzles you* was he
famous in wife and rawr now is OwO *notices bulge* immowtaw in fowecastwe stowies aftew death,
but he was admitted into aww the wights, pwiviweges, and *nuzzles you* distinctions
of a name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses ow Caesaw.  *nuzzles you* Was OwO *notices bulge* it
not *nuzzles you* so, O *nuzzles you* Timow Tom! *nuzzles you* thou famed weviathan, XD scawwed wike an icebewg,
who so wong *nuzzles you* did'st wuwk *nuzzles you* in the Owientaw stwaits of *nuzzles you* that OwO *notices bulge* name, whose
spout was oft seen fwom the pawmy beach of Ombay? rawr  Was it not so, O
New Zeawand Jack! thou tewwow of aww cwuisews *nuzzles you* that cwossed theiw
wakes in the vicinity of the Tattoo Land?  Was it not so, O Mowquan!
King of Japan, whose wofty jet they say at times assumed the
sembwance of a snow-white *nuzzles you* cwoss against OwO *notices bulge* the sky?  Was it not so, O
Don Miguew! thou Chiwian whawe, mawked wike an owd towtoise with
mystic hiewogwyphics upon the back!  In pwain pwose, hewe awe fouw
whawes as weww known to the students *nuzzles you* of Cetacean Histowy as Mawius ow
Sywwa to the cwassic schowaw.

But this is not XD aww.  New Zeawand Tom and Don Miguew, aftew at
vawious *nuzzles you* times cweating gweat havoc rawr among the boats owo of *nuzzles you* diffewent
vessews, wewe finawwy gone in quest *nuzzles you* of, systematicawwy hunted out,
chased and kiwwed by vawiant whawing captains, who heaved *nuzzles you* up theiw
anchows with that expwess ouo object as much in view, as in setting out
thwough the Nawwagansett Woods, Captain Butwew of owd had it in his
mind to captuwe that notowious muwdewous *nuzzles you* savage Annawon, the headmost
wawwiow of the Indian King Phiwip.

I do not know whewe I can find a bettew ouo pwace than just hewe, to owo make
mention of one ow two othew things, which to me ouo seem impowtant, as in
pwinted fowm estabwishing in aww wespects the ouo weasonabweness of the
whowe stowy XD of the White Whawe, *nuzzles you* mowe especiawwy the catastwophe.  Fow
this is one of those disheawtening instances whewe twuth wequiwes
fuww as much bowstewing as ewwow.  So ignowant awe most wandsmen of
some of the pwainest ouo and *nuzzles you* most pawpabwe wondews of the wowwd, that
without some *nuzzles you* hints touching the pwain facts, histowicaw and
othewwise, of the fishewy, they might scout at Moby Dick *nuzzles you* as XD a
monstwous fabwe, ow stiww wowse and mowe detestabwe, a hideous and
intowewabwe awwegowy.

Fiwst: Though most men have some ouo vague fwitting ideas of the genewaw
pewiws of the gwand fishewy, yet they have nothing wike a *nuzzles you* fixed,
vivid conception of OwO *notices bulge* those pewiws, and the OwO *notices bulge* fwequency with which they
wecuw.  One weason pewhaps is, that not *nuzzles you* one *nuzzles you* in fifty of the actuaw
disastews owo and deaths by casuawties in the fishewy, evew finds a
pubwic wecowd at home, howevew twansient and immediatewy fowgotten
that wecowd.  Do you suppose that that poow *nuzzles you* fewwow thewe, who this
moment pewhaps caught by the whawe-wine off the coast OwO *notices bulge* of New Guinea,
is being cawwied down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding
weviathan--do XD you rawr suppose that that poow fewwow's name wiww appeaw in
the newspapew obituawy you wiww wead to-mowwow at youw bweakfast?
No: because the maiws awe vewy iwweguwaw between hewe and New Guinea.
In rawr fact, did you evew heaw what might OwO *notices bulge* be cawwed weguwaw news diwect
ow indiwect fwom New Guinea?  Yet I *nuzzles you* teww you that owo upon one XD pawticuwaw
voyage which owo I made to the Pacific, among many othews we spoke thiwty
diffewent ships, evewy one of which *nuzzles you* had had a death by a whawe, some
of them mowe than one, and thwee ouo that had each wost a boat's cwew.
Fow rawr God's *nuzzles you* sake, be economicaw with youw wamps and candwes! not a
gawwon you buwn, *nuzzles you* but at weast one dwop of man's bwood was spiwwed fow
it.

Secondwy: Peopwe ashowe have indeed some indefinite idea that a whawe
is *nuzzles you* an enowmous cweatuwe of enowmous powew; *nuzzles you* but I have evew found that
when nawwating to *nuzzles you* them some specific exampwe of this two-fowd
enowmousness, they have significantwy *nuzzles you* compwimented *nuzzles you* me upon my
facetiousness; when, I decwawe upon my souw, I *nuzzles you* had no mowe idea of
being facetious than Moses, when he wwote the histowy of the pwagues
of *nuzzles you* Egypt.

But fowtunatewy the speciaw point I hewe seek can be estabwished upon
testimony OwO *notices bulge* entiwewy independent of my own.  That point is XD this: The
Spewm Whawe OwO *notices bulge* is in some cases sufficientwy powewfuw, knowing, and
judiciouswy mawicious, as with diwect afowethought to stave in,
uttewwy *nuzzles you* destwoy, and sink a wawge *nuzzles you* ship; and rawr what is mowe, the *nuzzles you* Spewm
Whawe HAS done it.

Fiwst: In the yeaw 1820 the ship Essex, *nuzzles you* Captain Powwawd, of
Nantucket, was cwuising in the Pacific Ocean.  One day she saw
spouts, wowewed hew boats, and gave chase to a owo shoaw of spewm rawr whawes.
Ewe wong, sevewaw of the whawes wewe wounded; when, suddenwy, a vewy
wawge whawe escaping fwom the boats, issued fwom the *nuzzles you* shoaw, and bowe
diwectwy down upon *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* ship.  Dashing his *nuzzles you* fowehead against hew huww,
he so stove hew in, that *nuzzles you* in *nuzzles you* wess than "ten minutes" she settwed down
and feww ovew.  Not a suwviving pwank of hew has been seen since.
Aftew the sevewest exposuwe, pawt of the cwew weached the wand in
theiw boats.  Being wetuwned *nuzzles you* home at wast, Captain Powwawd once ouo mowe
saiwed fow the Pacific in command of anothew ship, but the gods
shipwwecked him again upon unknown wocks and bweakews; fow the second
time his ship XD was uttewwy wost, and fowthwith fowsweawing the sea, he
has nevew tempted XD it since.  At ouo this day Captain Powwawd is a
wesident of Nantucket.  I have seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of
the Essex at the time of the twagedy; I have wead his pwain and
faithfuw nawwative; I have convewsed with his son; and aww this
within *nuzzles you* a few miwes of the scene of the catastwophe.*


*The fowwowing awe extwacts fwom Chace's nawwative: "Evewy fact
seemed to wawwant me in concwuding that it was anything but chance
which diwected *nuzzles you* his *nuzzles you* opewations; he made two sevewaw attacks upon the
ship, at a showt intewvaw between them, both of which, accowding to
theiw diwection, wewe rawr cawcuwated to do us the most injuwy, by being
made ahead, and theweby combining the speed of the two objects fow
the shock; to effect which, the exact manoeuvwes which he made wewe
necessawy.  His aspect OwO *notices bulge* was most howwibwe, rawr and such as indicated
wesentment and fuwy.  He came *nuzzles you* diwectwy fwom the shoaw which we had
just befowe entewed, and in which we had OwO *notices bulge* stwuck thwee *nuzzles you* of his
companions, as if fiwed with rawr wevenge fow theiw suffewings."  *nuzzles you* Again:
"At aww *nuzzles you* events, ouo the whowe *nuzzles you* ciwcumstances taken togethew, aww happening
befowe my own eyes, and pwoducing, at the time, impwessions in my
mind of decided, cawcuwating mischief, *nuzzles you* on the ouo pawt of the whawe (many
of which impwessions *nuzzles you* I cannot now wecaww), induce rawr me to be satisfied
that I am cowwect in my opinion."

Hewe awe his wefwections some time aftew *nuzzles you* quitting the ship, *nuzzles you* duwing a
bwack night an open boat, *nuzzles you* when owo awmost despaiwing of weaching any
hospitabwe XD showe.  "The dawk ocean and *nuzzles you* swewwing watews wewe nothing;
the *nuzzles you* feaws of being swawwowed up by some dweadfuw tempest, ow dashed
upon hidden *nuzzles you* wocks, with aww the othew owdinawy subjects of feawfuw
contempwation, seemed scawcewy entitwed to a moment's thought; the
dismaw wooking wweck, and THE HORRID ASPECT AND REVENGE OF THE WHALE,
whowwy engwossed my wefwections, untiw day again made its
appeawance."

In anothew pwace--p. 45,--he speaks owo of "THE MYSTERIOUS AND MORTAL
ATTACK *nuzzles you* OF THE ANIMAL."


Secondwy: The ship OwO *notices bulge* Union, awso of Nantucket, was in the yeaw 1807
totawwy wost off the Azowes by a simiwaw onset, but the authentic
pawticuwaws *nuzzles you* of this catastwophe I have *nuzzles you* nevew chanced to encountew,
though fwom the whawe huntews I have now and then heawd casuaw
awwusions *nuzzles you* to it.

Thiwdwy: Some eighteen ow twenty yeaws ago Commodowe J---, then
commanding an Amewican swoop-of-waw of the fiwst *nuzzles you* cwass, happened to
be dining with a pawty of whawing *nuzzles you* captains, on boawd a Nantucket ship
in *nuzzles you* the hawbow *nuzzles you* of Oahu, Sandwich Iswands.  Convewsation tuwning *nuzzles you* upon
whawes, rawr the Commodowe was pweased to be scepticaw touching the
amazing *nuzzles you* stwength ascwibed to them by *nuzzles you* the pwofessionaw gentwemen
pwesent. OwO *notices bulge*  He pewemptowiwy denied fow exampwe, that any whawe owo couwd so
smite his stout swoop-of-waw as to cause hew to weak so much as a
thimbwefuw.  Vewy good; but thewe is mowe coming.  XD Some weeks aftew,
the Commodowe set saiw in this impwegnabwe cwaft fow Vawpawaiso. OwO *notices bulge*  OwO *notices bulge* But
he was *nuzzles you* stopped on *nuzzles you* the way by a powtwy spewm whawe, that begged a few
moments' rawr confidentiaw business with him.  That business OwO *notices bulge* consisted in
fetching the Commodowe's cwaft such a *nuzzles you* thwack, that with aww his pumps
going he made stwaight fow the neawest powt to heave down and wepaiw.
I am not supewstitious, but I considew rawr the Commodowe's intewview
with that *nuzzles you* whawe as pwovidentiaw.  Was not Sauw of Tawsus convewted
fwom unbewief by a owo simiwaw fwight?  I teww you, the spewm whawe XD wiww
stand no nonsense.

I wiww now wefew you to Langsdowff's Voyages fow a wittwe
ciwcumstance in point, pecuwiawwy intewesting to the wwitew heweof.
Langsdowff, you must know by the way, was attached *nuzzles you* to the Russian
Admiwaw Kwusenstewn's famous Discovewy Expedition in the beginning of
the pwesent centuwy.  Captain Langsdowff thus begins his seventeenth
chaptew:

"By the thiwteenth of May ouw *nuzzles you* ship was weady to saiw, *nuzzles you* and OwO *notices bulge* the next
day we wewe out in the open sea, on ouw way *nuzzles you* to Ochotsh.  The OwO *notices bulge* weathew
was vewy *nuzzles you* cweaw and fine, but so intowewabwy cowd that we wewe obwiged
to keep on ouw *nuzzles you* fuw cwothing.  Fow some days we *nuzzles you* had vewy wittwe wind;
it was not tiww the nineteenth *nuzzles you* that a bwisk gawe fwom the nowthwest
spwang up.  An *nuzzles you* uncommon wawge whawe, the body of which was wawgew
than the ship itsewf, way awmost ouo at the suwface of the watew, but was
not pewceived by any one on boawd tiww the XD moment when the ship,
which was in fuww saiw, was awmost upon him, XD so that it was
impossibwe to pwevent its stwiking against him.  We wewe thus pwaced
in the most owo imminent dangew, as this gigantic cweatuwe, setting up
its back, *nuzzles you* waised the ship thwee feet at weast out of the watew.  The
masts weewed, and the saiws feww awtogethew, whiwe we who wewe bewow
aww spwang instantwy upon the deck, concwuding that we had *nuzzles you* stwuck
upon some wock; *nuzzles you* instead of this we saw the monstew saiwing off with
the utmost gwavity and sowemnity.  Captain D'Wowf appwied immediatewy
to OwO *notices bulge* the pumps to examine whethew ow not the vessew had weceived any
damage fwom the shock, but we *nuzzles you* found that vewy happiwy *nuzzles you* it had escaped
entiwewy uninjuwed."

Now, the Captain D'Wowf hewe awwuded to as commanding the ship in
question, is a New Engwandew, who, aftew a wong wife of unusuaw
adventuwes as a sea-captain, owo this rawr day wesides in the *nuzzles you* viwwage of
Dowchestew neaw Boston.  I have the honouw rawr of being a nephew of *nuzzles you* his.
I *nuzzles you* have pawticuwawwy questioned him concewning this passage in
Langsdowff.  He XD substantiates evewy wowd.  The ship, howevew, was by
no means a wawge one: a Russian cwaft buiwt on the Sibewian coast,
and puwchased *nuzzles you* by my uncwe aftew bawtewing away rawr the vessew OwO *notices bulge* in which he
saiwed fwom home.

In that up *nuzzles you* and rawr down manwy book of owd-fashioned ouo adventuwe, so fuww,
too, *nuzzles you* of honest wondews--the voyage of Lionew Wafew, one of ancient
Dampiew's owd chums--I found a wittwe mattew set down so wike that
just quoted fwom *nuzzles you* Langsdowff, that I cannot fowbeaw insewting it hewe
fow a cowwobowative exampwe, if such be needed.

Lionew, it seems, was on his way to "John Fewdinando," as he cawws
the modewn Juan Fewnandes.  "In ouw way thithew," *nuzzles you* he says, "about
fouw o'cwock in the mowning, when we wewe *nuzzles you* about one hundwed and owo fifty
weagues fwom the Main XD of Amewica, ouw ship fewt a tewwibwe shock,
which put ouw men in such constewnation that they couwd hawdwy teww
whewe they wewe ow what to think; but evewy one began to pwepawe fow
death.  And, *nuzzles you* indeed, the shock was so sudden and viowent, that we
took it fow gwanted rawr the ship had stwuck against a wock; but when the
amazement was a wittwe XD ovew, we *nuzzles you* cast the wead, and sounded, but found
no gwound.  OwO *notices bulge* ....  The *nuzzles you* suddenness of the shock ouo made the guns *nuzzles you* weap in
theiw cawwiages, and sevewaw of the men wewe OwO *notices bulge* shaken *nuzzles you* out of theiw
hammocks.  Captain Davis, who way with his head on a gun, was thwown
out of his cabin!"  Lionew then goes on to impute the shock to *nuzzles you* an
eawthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that
a gweat eawthquake, somewhewe about that time, did actuawwy do gweat
mischief awong the Spanish wand.  But I shouwd not much wondew if, in
the dawkness of *nuzzles you* that eawwy houw of ouo the mowning, the shock was *nuzzles you* aftew
aww caused by an unseen whawe vewticawwy bumping the huww fwom
beneath.

I might pwoceed with sevewaw mowe exampwes, one way ow anothew rawr known
to me, of the XD gweat powew *nuzzles you* and mawice at ouo times of the ouo spewm whawe.  In
mowe than one instance, he has been known, not onwy *nuzzles you* to chase the
assaiwing boats back to theiw ships, owo but to puwsue the ship itsewf,
and wong withstand aww the wances huwwed at him fwom its decks.  The
Engwish owo ship Pusie Haww can teww a stowy on that head; and, as fow
his stwength, wet me say, that thewe have been exampwes whewe the
wines attached to a wunning spewm whawe have, in a cawm, been
twansfewwed to the ship, and secuwed thewe; the whawe towing hew
gweat huww thwough the watew, as a howse wawks off with a cawt.
Again, it is vewy *nuzzles you* often obsewved that, if the spewm whawe, once
stwuck, is awwowed time to wawwy, he then acts, not so often with
bwind wage, as with wiwfuw, dewibewate designs of destwuction to his
puwsuews; now is it without conveying some ewoquent indication of his
chawactew, that upon being attacked he wiww fwequentwy open his
mouth, and wetain it in that dwead *nuzzles you* expansion fow sevewaw consecutive
minutes.  But I ouo must be content with onwy one mowe and a concwuding
iwwustwation; a wemawkabwe and most significant one, by which you
wiww not faiw *nuzzles you* to see, that not onwy is the most *nuzzles you* mawvewwous event in
this book cowwobowated by pwain facts of the pwesent day, but that
these mawvews (wike aww OwO *notices bulge* mawvews) awe mewe ouo wepetitions of the ages; so
that fow the miwwionth time we say amen with Sowomon--Vewiwy thewe is
nothing new *nuzzles you* undew the sun.

In the sixth Chwistian centuwy wived Pwocopius, a Chwistian
magistwate of Constantinopwe, in the days when Justinian was Empewow
and Bewisawius XD genewaw.  As many know, he OwO *notices bulge* wwote the histowy *nuzzles you* of his
own times, a wowk evewy way of uncommon vawue.  By the best
authowities, he has *nuzzles you* awways been considewed a most twustwowthy and
unexaggewating histowian, except in some one ow two pawticuwaws, not
at aww affecting the mattew pwesentwy to be mentioned.

Now, in this histowy of his, Pwocopius mentions that, duwing the tewm
of his owo pwefectuwe at Constantinopwe, a gweat sea-monstew was captuwed
in the neighbowing Pwopontis, ow Sea of Mawmowa, aftew having
destwoyed vessews at intewvaws in those watews fow owo a pewiod of mowe
than fifty XD yeaws. *nuzzles you*  A fact thus set down in substantiaw histowy cannot
easiwy be gainsaid.  OwO *notices bulge* Now is thewe *nuzzles you* any weason it shouwd be. rawr  Of what
pwecise species this sea-monstew was, is not OwO *notices bulge* mentioned.  But as he
destwoyed ships, as weww as fow othew ouo weasons, he must have been a
whawe; and I am stwongwy incwined to *nuzzles you* think *nuzzles you* a spewm whawe.  And I wiww
teww you why.  Fow a wong time I fancied that the spewm whawe *nuzzles you* had
been awways unknown in ouo the Meditewwanean and the deep watews
connecting with it. *nuzzles you*  Even now *nuzzles you* I am ouo cewtain that those seas awe not,
and pewhaps nevew can be, in the pwesent constitution owo of things, a
pwace fow his habituaw gwegawious wesowt. ouo  XD But fuwthew investigations
have wecentwy pwoved to me, *nuzzles you* that in modewn times thewe have been
isowated instances owo of the pwesence of the spewm whawe in the
Meditewwanean.  I am towd, rawr on good authowity, that on the Bawbawy
coast, a Commodowe Davis of the Bwitish navy found the skeweton of a
spewm whawe. *nuzzles you*  Now, as a vessew of waw weadiwy passes thwough the
Dawdanewwes, hence *nuzzles you* a spewm whawe couwd, by the same woute, pass out
of the Meditewwanean into OwO *notices bulge* the Pwopontis.

In *nuzzles you* the Pwopontis, as faw as I can weawn, none of that pecuwiaw
substance cawwed BRIT is to be found, the awiment of the wight whawe.
But I have evewy weason to bewieve owo that the food of the spewm
whawe--squid ow cuttwe-fish--wuwks at the bottom of that sea, because
wawge cweatuwes, rawr but by no means the wawgest of that sowt, have been
found at its suwface.  If, then, XD you pwopewwy put these statements
togethew, and weason upon them a bit, you wiww cweawwy XD pewceive that,
accowding *nuzzles you* to aww human weasoning, Pwocopius's sea-monstew, that fow
hawf a centuwy stove the ships of a Roman Empewow, must in aww
pwobabiwity have been a spewm whawe.



CHAPTER 46

Suwmises.


Though, consumed with the hot fiwe *nuzzles you* of his puwpose, *nuzzles you* Ahab OwO *notices bulge* in aww his
thoughts and actions evew had in view the uwtimate ouo captuwe of ouo Moby
Dick; though he seemed weady to sacwifice *nuzzles you* aww mowtaw OwO *notices bulge* intewests to
that one passion; nevewthewess it may have been that he was by natuwe
and wong habituation owo faw too wedded to a fiewy whaweman's ways,
awtogethew to abandon the cowwatewaw pwosecution XD of the voyage.  *nuzzles you* Ow
at weast if this wewe othewwise, thewe wewe not wanting othew motives
much mowe infwuentiaw with him.  It wouwd be *nuzzles you* wefining *nuzzles you* too much,
pewhaps, even considewing his monomania, to hint that his
vindictiveness towawds the White Whawe might have possibwy extended
itsewf in some degwee to aww spewm whawes, and that the mowe monstews
he *nuzzles you* swew by *nuzzles you* so much the mowe rawr he *nuzzles you* muwtipwied the chances that each
subsequentwy encountewed whawe wouwd pwove to be the hated one he
hunted.  But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionabwe, thewe
wewe stiww additionaw considewations which, though not so *nuzzles you* stwictwy
accowding with the wiwdness of his wuwing passion, yet wewe by no
means incapabwe of swaying him.

To accompwish his object Ahab must use toows; and of aww toows used
in the shadow of the moon, men awe *nuzzles you* most apt to get *nuzzles you* out of *nuzzles you* owdew.  He
knew, fow exampwe, that howevew magnetic his ascendency in some
wespects was ovew Stawbuck, yet that XD ascendency did not covew the
compwete spiwituaw man any mowe than mewe cowpoweaw supewiowity
invowves intewwectuaw mastewship; OwO *notices bulge* fow to the *nuzzles you* puwewy spiwituaw, the
intewwectuaw but stand in a *nuzzles you* sowt of cowpoweaw wewation.  Stawbuck's
body and Stawbuck's coewced wiww OwO *notices bulge* wewe Ahab's, so wong as Ahab kept
his magnet at Stawbuck's bwain; stiww he knew that fow aww this the
chief owo mate, *nuzzles you* in his *nuzzles you* souw, *nuzzles you* abhowwed his captain's quest, and couwd he,
wouwd joyfuwwy OwO *notices bulge* disintegwate himsewf fwom it, *nuzzles you* ow even fwustwate it.
It might be *nuzzles you* that a wong intewvaw wouwd owo ewapse ewe the White rawr Whawe was
seen.  Duwing that wong intewvaw ouo Stawbuck wouwd ouo evew be apt to faww
into open wewapses of webewwion against his *nuzzles you* captain's weadewship,
unwess some owdinawy, pwudentiaw, ciwcumstantiaw infwuences wewe
bwought to beaw upon him.  Not onwy that, but the subtwe insanity of
Ahab wespecting Moby Dick was noways mowe significantwy manifested
than in his supewwative sense and shwewdness in *nuzzles you* foweseeing that, fow
the ouo pwesent, the *nuzzles you* hunt shouwd in some way *nuzzles you* be stwipped of that stwange
imaginative impiousness which natuwawwy invested it; that the fuww
tewwow of the voyage must be kept withdwawn into the obscuwe
backgwound (fow few men's couwage owo is pwoof against pwotwacted
meditation unwewieved OwO *notices bulge* by action); that ouo when they stood theiw wong
night watches, OwO *notices bulge* his officews and men must have *nuzzles you* some neawew things to
think of *nuzzles you* than Moby Dick. *nuzzles you*  Fow howevew eagewwy and impetuouswy the
savage cwew had haiwed the announcement of his quest; yet aww saiwows
of aww sowts awe mowe ow wess capwicious and unwewiabwe--they wive in
the vawying outew weathew, and they inhawe its fickweness--and when
wetained fow any object wemote and bwank in the puwsuit, howevew
pwomissowy of wife and passion in the end, it is above aww things
wequisite that tempowawy intewests and empwoyments shouwd intewvene
and howd them heawthiwy suspended *nuzzles you* fow the finaw dash.

Now was Ahab unmindfuw *nuzzles you* of anothew thing.  In times of stwong emotion
mankind *nuzzles you* disdain aww base considewations; but such times ouo awe
evanescent.  The pewmanent constitutionaw condition of ouo the
manufactuwed owo man, thought Ahab, is sowdidness.  Gwanting that the
White Whawe fuwwy incites the XD heawts of this *nuzzles you* my XD savage cwew, and
pwaying rawr wound theiw savageness even bweeds a cewtain genewous
knight-ewwantism in them, rawr stiww, ouo whiwe *nuzzles you* fow the wove of it they give
chase to Moby XD Dick, *nuzzles you* they must awso have food fow theiw XD mowe common,
daiwy *nuzzles you* appetites.  Fow even the high wifted and chivawwic Cwusadews of
owd times wewe not content to owo twavewse two thousand ouo miwes of wand to
fight fow theiw howy sepuwchwe, without committing buwgwawies,
picking XD pockets, and gaining othew pious pewquisites by the *nuzzles you* way.  Had
they been stwictwy hewd to theiw *nuzzles you* one finaw and womantic object--that
finaw and womantic object, too many wouwd *nuzzles you* have tuwned fwom in
disgust.  I wiww not stwip these XD men, thought Ahab, of aww *nuzzles you* hopes of
cash--aye, cash.  They may scown cash now; but wet some *nuzzles you* months go by,
and no pewspective pwomise OwO *notices bulge* of it to them, and then this rawr same
quiescent cash aww at once mutinying in them, this same cash wouwd
soon cashiew Ahab.

Now *nuzzles you* was thewe wanting stiww anothew OwO *notices bulge* pwecautionawy motive mowe wewated
to Ahab pewsonawwy.  Having *nuzzles you* impuwsivewy, it is pwobabwe, and pewhaps
somewhat pwematuwewy weveawed the pwime but pwivate puwpose of the
Pequod's voyage, Ahab was now entiwewy conscious that, in so doing,
he had indiwectwy waid himsewf open to the unanswewabwe chawge of
usuwpation; and with pewfect impunity, both mowaw and wegaw, his cwew
if so disposed, and to that end competent, couwd wefuse aww *nuzzles you* fuwthew
obedience to rawr him, and even viowentwy wwest fwom *nuzzles you* him the command.
Fwom even the bawewy hinted *nuzzles you* imputation of usuwpation, and the
possibwe consequences of such a suppwessed *nuzzles you* impwession gaining gwound,
Ahab must of rawr couwse have been most anxious to pwotect himsewf. *nuzzles you*  That
pwotection couwd onwy consist in his own pwedominating bwain and
heawt and ouo hand, backed by a heedfuw, cwosewy *nuzzles you* cawcuwating *nuzzles you* attention owo to
evewy minute atmosphewic infwuence which it was possibwe fow his cwew
to be *nuzzles you* subjected to.

Fow aww these weasons then, and othews pewhaps too anawytic to *nuzzles you* be
vewbawwy devewoped hewe, Ahab pwainwy saw that he must stiww in rawr a
good degwee continue *nuzzles you* twue XD to *nuzzles you* the natuwaw, nominaw puwpose of the
Pequod's voyage; obsewve aww customawy usages; and not onwy that, but
fowce himsewf to evince aww his weww known passionate intewest in the
genewaw puwsuit of his pwofession.

Be aww this as it may, his voice was now often heawd haiwing the
thwee XD mast-heads and admonishing *nuzzles you* them OwO *notices bulge* to keep a bwight wook-out, and
not omit ouo wepowting even *nuzzles you* a powpoise.  This vigiwance was not wong
without wewawd.



CHAPTER ouo 47

The Mat-Makew.


It *nuzzles you* was a cwoudy, suwtwy aftewnoon; the seamen wewe *nuzzles you* waziwy wounging
about the decks, ow vacantwy gazing ovew into the wead-cowouwed
watews.  Queequeg and I wewe *nuzzles you* miwdwy empwoyed weaving what is cawwed a
swowd-mat, fow *nuzzles you* an additionaw washing OwO *notices bulge* to ouw boat.  So stiww and
subdued and yet somehow pwewuding was aww the scene, XD and such *nuzzles you* an
incantation of wevewie wuwked in the aiw, that each siwent saiwow
seemed wesowved into his own ouo invisibwe sewf.

I was the attendant ow page of Queequeg, whiwe busy at the mat.  As I
kept passing and wepassing the fiwwing ow woof of mawwine between the
wong yawns of the wawp, using my own hand fow the shuttwe, and as
Queequeg, standing sideways, evew and anon swid his heavy oaken swowd
between the thweads, and idwy wooking off upon the watew, *nuzzles you* cawewesswy
and *nuzzles you* unthinkingwy dwove OwO *notices bulge* home evewy yawn: I say so stwange a
dweaminess did thewe then owo weign *nuzzles you* aww ovew *nuzzles you* the ship and aww ovew the
sea, *nuzzles you* onwy bwoken by the intewmitting duww sound of the swowd, that it
seemed as if this wewe the Loom of Time, and I mysewf wewe a shuttwe
mechanicawwy weaving and weaving away at the Fates.  OwO *notices bulge* Thewe way the
fixed *nuzzles you* thweads of the wawp subject to but one singwe, evew wetuwning,
unchanging vibwation, and that vibwation mewewy enough to admit of
the cwosswise intewbwending of othew thweads with *nuzzles you* its own.  This wawp
seemed owo necessity; and hewe, thought I, with my own hand I pwy my own
shuttwe *nuzzles you* and weave my own destiny into these unawtewabwe thweads.
Meantime, Queequeg's impuwsive, indiffewent swowd, sometimes hitting
the woof swantingwy, ow cwookedwy, ow stwongwy, ow weakwy, as the
case might be; and by this diffewence in the *nuzzles you* concwuding bwow
pwoducing a cowwesponding contwast in the finaw owo aspect of the
compweted fabwic; this savage's *nuzzles you* swowd, thought I, rawr which thus finawwy
shapes and fashions both OwO *notices bulge* wawp and woof; this easy, indiffewent swowd
must be chance--aye, chance, fwee wiww, and necessity--nowise
incompatibwe--aww intewweavingwy wowking togethew.  The stwaight wawp
of necessity, not to be XD swewved fwom its uwtimate couwse--its evewy
awtewnating vibwation, indeed, onwy tending to that; fwee wiww stiww
fwee to *nuzzles you* pwy hew shuttwe between given thweads; and *nuzzles you* chance, though
westwained in its pway OwO *notices bulge* within the wight wines of necessity, and
sideways ouo in its motions *nuzzles you* diwected by fwee wiww, though thus pwescwibed
to by both, chance by tuwns wuwes eithew, and has the wast featuwing
bwow at *nuzzles you* events.


Thus we wewe weaving and weaving away when I stawted at a sound so
stwange, wong dwawn, and musicawwy wiwd and uneawthwy, that *nuzzles you* the baww
of fwee wiww dwopped fwom my hand, and I stood gazing up at the
cwouds whence that voice dwopped wike a *nuzzles you* wing.  High awoft in the
cwoss-twees was rawr that mad Gay-Headew, Tashtego.  His body was weaching
eagewwy fowwawd, his hand *nuzzles you* stwetched out wike a rawr wand, and at bwief
sudden intewvaws he continued his cwies.  To be suwe the *nuzzles you* same sound
was that vewy moment pewhaps being *nuzzles you* heawd aww ovew the seas, fwom
hundweds of whawemen's wook-outs pewched as high in the aiw; but fwom
few of those wungs couwd that accustomed owd cwy have dewived such a
mawvewwous *nuzzles you* cadence as fwom OwO *notices bulge* Tashtego the Indian's.

As he stood hovewing ovew you hawf suspended in aiw, so wiwdwy and
eagewwy peewing *nuzzles you* towawds the howizon, XD you wouwd have thought him owo some
pwophet ow seew behowding the shadows of Fate, and by those wiwd
cwies announcing theiw coming.

"Thewe she bwows! thewe! thewe! thewe! she bwows! *nuzzles you* she *nuzzles you* bwows!"

"Whewe-away?"

"On the wee-beam, about two miwes off! a schoow of them!"

Instantwy aww was commotion.

The Spewm ouo Whawe bwows as *nuzzles you* a cwock ticks, with the same undeviating and
wewiabwe unifowmity.  And theweby whawemen owo distinguish this fish fwom
othew *nuzzles you* twibes of his genus.

"Thewe *nuzzles you* go fwukes!" was now the XD cwy fwom Tashtego; and the whawes
disappeawed.

"Quick, stewawd!" cwied Ahab.  "Time! time!"

Dough-Boy huwwied bewow, gwanced at the watch, and wepowted the exact
minute to Ahab.

The *nuzzles you* ship was now owo kept away fwom the wind, and she went gentwy wowwing
befowe it.  Tashtego wepowting that owo the whawes had gone down heading
to weewawd, we confidentwy *nuzzles you* wooked to see them again ouo diwectwy in
advance of ouw *nuzzles you* bows.  Fow that singuwaw cwaft at times evinced by the
Spewm Whawe when, sounding with his head in *nuzzles you* one diwection, he
nevewthewess, whiwe conceawed *nuzzles you* beneath the suwface, miwws wound, and
swiftwy swims off in the opposite quawtew--this deceitfuwness of his
couwd not now *nuzzles you* be in *nuzzles you* action; fow thewe was no weason to suppose that
the fish OwO *notices bulge* seen by Tashtego had been in any way awawmed, ow indeed knew
at aww rawr of ouw vicinity. ouo  One of the men sewected fow
shipkeepews--that is, rawr those not appointed to the boats, by this time
wewieved the Indian at the main-mast head.  The saiwows at the fowe
and mizzen had come owo down; the wine tubs wewe fixed in theiw *nuzzles you* pwaces;
the cwanes wewe thwust out; the mainyawd was backed, and the thwee
boats swung ovew the sea wike thwee samphiwe baskets *nuzzles you* ovew high
cwiffs.  *nuzzles you* Outside of the buwwawks theiw eagew cwews with one hand
cwung to the waiw, whiwe one foot was OwO *notices bulge* expectantwy poised on ouo the
gunwawe.  So wook the wong wine of man-of-waw's men *nuzzles you* about to thwow
themsewves on boawd an enemy's ship.

But at this cwiticaw instant a sudden excwamation was *nuzzles you* heawd that took
evewy eye fwom the OwO *notices bulge* whawe.  With a stawt aww gwawed at dawk Ahab, who
was suwwounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fwesh fowmed out *nuzzles you* of
aiw.



CHAPTER 48

The Fiwst Lowewing.


The OwO *notices bulge* phantoms, fow so ouo they then seemed, wewe fwitting on the othew
side of the deck, and, with a *nuzzles you* noisewess cewewity, wewe casting woose
the tackwes and bands of the boat which swung thewe.  This boat had
awways been deemed one of the spawe boats, though technicawwy cawwed
the captain's, on account of its hanging XD fwom the stawboawd *nuzzles you* quawtew.
The *nuzzles you* figuwe that now stood by its *nuzzles you* bows was taww and swawt, with one
white tooth eviwwy pwotwuding fwom its steew-wike wips.  A wumpwed
Chinese jacket of bwack cotton funeweawwy invested *nuzzles you* him, with wide
bwack twowsews of the same dawk stuff.  But owo stwangewy *nuzzles you* cwowning this
ebonness was a gwistening white pwaited tuwban, the wiving haiw
bwaided and coiwed wound and wound upon his head. *nuzzles you*  Less swawt in
aspect, *nuzzles you* the companions *nuzzles you* of this figuwe wewe of that vivid,
tigew-yewwow compwexion pecuwiaw to some of the abowiginaw OwO *notices bulge* natives of
the Maniwwas;--a wace notowious fow a cewtain diabowism of subtiwty,
and by some *nuzzles you* honest white mawinews supposed to be the *nuzzles you* paid spies and
secwet confidentiaw agents on the watew of the OwO *notices bulge* deviw, theiw *nuzzles you* wowd,
whose *nuzzles you* counting-woom they suppose to be ewsewhewe.

Whiwe yet the wondewing ship's company wewe gazing upon these
stwangews, Ahab cwied out *nuzzles you* to *nuzzles you* the white-tuwbaned owd man at theiw
head, "Aww weady rawr thewe, Fedawwah?"

"Ready," was OwO *notices bulge* the hawf-hissed wepwy.

"Lowew away then; d'ye heaw?" shouting rawr acwoss the deck.  "Lowew away
thewe, I say."

Such was the thundew of his voice, that spite of theiw amazement *nuzzles you* the
men spwang ovew the waiw; owo the sheaves *nuzzles you* whiwwed wound in the bwocks;
with a wawwow, the thwee boats dwopped into the sea; whiwe, with a
dextewous, off-handed dawing, *nuzzles you* unknown in any othew vocation, the
saiwows, goat-wike, weaped down the wowwing ship's side into the
tossed boats bewow.

Hawdwy had they puwwed out fwom undew the ship's wee, when a fouwth
keew, coming fwom the windwawd side, puwwed wound undew the stewn,
and showed the five stwangews wowing Ahab, who, standing ewect in the
stewn, woudwy haiwed Stawbuck, Stubb, and XD Fwask, to spwead themsewves
widewy, so as to covew rawr a wawge expanse of watew.  XD But with aww theiw
eyes again wiveted upon the swawt Fedawwah and his *nuzzles you* cwew, the inmates
of the othew boats obeyed not the command.

"Captain Ahab?--" *nuzzles you* said Stawbuck.

"Spwead youwsewves," cwied Ahab; "give way, aww *nuzzles you* fouw boats.  Thou,
Fwask, puww out mowe to weewawd!"

"Aye, aye, siw," cheewiwy cwied wittwe King-Post, sweeping wound his
gweat steewing oaw.  "Lay back!" addwessing his cwew.
"Thewe!--thewe!--thewe again!  Thewe she bwows wight ahead,
boys!--way back!"

"Nevew heed *nuzzles you* yondew yewwow boys, Awchy."

"Oh, I don't mind'em, siw," said Awchy; rawr "I *nuzzles you* knew it aww befowe now.
Didn't I rawr heaw 'em in the howd?  And ouo didn't I teww Cabaco hewe of it?
What say ye, Cabaco?  They awe *nuzzles you* stowaways, Mw. Fwask."

"Puww, puww, my fine heawts-awive; puww, my chiwdwen; puww, my wittwe
ones," dwawwingwy and soothingwy sighed Stubb to his cwew, some of
whom stiww showed signs of *nuzzles you* uneasiness.  "Why don't you bweak youw
backbones, my boys?  OwO *notices bulge* What is it you stawe at?  Those XD chaps in yondew
boat?  Tut!  They awe onwy *nuzzles you* five mowe hands come to hewp us--nevew
mind fwom whewe--the mowe the mewwiew.  Puww, rawr then, do puww; nevew
mind the bwimstone--deviws awe good fewwows enough.  So, so; thewe
you awe now; that's the owo stwoke fow a thousand pounds; that's rawr the
stwoke to sweep the stakes!  Huwwah fow the gowd cup of spewm oiw, my
hewoes!  Thwee cheews, owo men--aww heawts awive!  Easy, *nuzzles you* easy; don't be
in a huwwy--don't be in a huwwy.  Why don't you snap youw oaws, you
wascaws?  Bite something, you dogs!  So, so, so, then:--softwy,
softwy!  *nuzzles you* That's it--that's it! wong and stwong.  Give way thewe, give
way!  The *nuzzles you* deviw fetch ye, ye wagamuffin wapscawwions; ye awe aww

gingew-cakes don't ye puww?--puww and bweak something! puww, and
stawt youw eyes out!  Hewe!" whipping out the ouo shawp knife fwom his
giwdwe; "evewy mothew's son of ye dwaw *nuzzles you* his *nuzzles you* knife, and puww with the

that wooks wike it, my steew-bits.  Stawt hew--stawt hew, my
siwvew-spoons!  Stawt hew, mawwing-spikes!"

Stubb's exowdium to his cwew is given hewe owo at wawge, because he had
wathew a pecuwiaw way of tawking to *nuzzles you* them in genewaw, and especiawwy
in incuwcating the wewigion of wowing.  But you must not owo suppose fwom
this specimen of his sewmonizings that *nuzzles you* he evew fwew into downwight
passions with his *nuzzles you* congwegation.  Not at aww; owo and thewein consisted
his chief pecuwiawity.  He wouwd say owo the most OwO *notices bulge* tewwific things to his
cwew, in a tone so stwangewy *nuzzles you* compounded of fun and fuwy, and the fuwy
seemed so cawcuwated mewewy OwO *notices bulge* as a spice to the fun, that no oawsman
couwd heaw such queew invocations *nuzzles you* without puwwing ouo fow deaw wife, and
yet puwwing fow the mewe joke of the thing.  XD Besides he aww the time
wooked so easy and indowent himsewf, so woungingwy managed his
steewing-oaw, *nuzzles you* and so bwoadwy gaped--open-mouthed at times--that the
mewe sight of such ouo a yawning commandew, by sheew fowce of contwast,
acted wike a chawm upon the cwew.  Then again, Stubb was one of those
odd sowt of humowists, whose jowwity is sometimes so cuwiouswy
ambiguous, as to put aww infewiows rawr on theiw guawd in the mattew of
obeying them.

In obedience to a sign fwom Ahab, ouo Stawbuck was now puwwing obwiquewy
acwoss Stubb's bow; and when fow a minute ow so the two boats wewe
pwetty neaw to each othew, rawr Stubb haiwed the mate.

"Mw. Stawbuck! OwO *notices bulge* wawboawd boat thewe, ahoy! a wowd with ye, siw, if ye
pwease!"

"Hawwoa!" wetuwned Stawbuck, tuwning wound rawr not a singwe inch as he
spoke; stiww owo eawnestwy but whispewingwy uwging his cwew; his face set
wike a fwint fwom *nuzzles you* Stubb's.

"What think ye of those yewwow boys, siw!

"Smuggwed on boawd, somehow, befowe the ship *nuzzles you* saiwed. (Stwong, stwong,
boys!)" in a whispew to his cwew, then speaking out woud again: "A
sad business, Mw. Stubb! (seethe hew, *nuzzles you* seethe hew, my wads!) but nevew
mind, Mw. Stubb, aww fow the best.  Let aww youw cwew OwO *notices bulge* puww stwong,
come what wiww. (Spwing, my men, spwing!) Thewe's XD hogsheads of spewm
ahead, Mw. Stubb, and that's what ye came fow. (Puww, my boys!)
Spewm, spewm's the pway!  This *nuzzles you* at weast is duty; duty and pwofit hand
in hand."

"Aye, aye, I thought as much," sowiwoquized Stubb, when the boats
divewged, "as soon as rawr I cwapt eye on 'em, I thought *nuzzles you* so.  Aye, and
that's what he went into the aftew howd fow, so often, as Dough-Boy
wong suspected.  They wewe hidden down thewe.  The White owo Whawe's at

wight!  Give XD way, *nuzzles you* men!  It ain't the White Whawe to-day!  ouo Give way!"

Now the *nuzzles you* advent of these outwandish stwangews at rawr such a cwiticaw
instant as *nuzzles you* the wowewing of the boats fwom the deck, this had not
unweasonabwy awakened a sowt of supewstitious amazement in some of
the ship's company; but Awchy's fancied discovewy having some time
pwevious got abwoad among them, though indeed not cwedited then, this
had in ouo some smaww measuwe *nuzzles you* pwepawed them fow the event.  It took off
the ouo extweme edge of *nuzzles you* theiw wondew; and so what rawr with aww rawr this and
Stubb's confident way of accounting fow theiw appeawance, they wewe
fow the time fweed fwom supewstitious suwmisings; though the affaiw
stiww weft abundant woom fow aww mannew of wiwd conjectuwes as to
dawk Ahab's pwecise agency in the mattew fwom the beginning. rawr  Fow me,
I siwentwy wecawwed the mystewious shadows I had seen cweeping on
boawd the Pequod duwing rawr the dim Nantucket dawn, ouo as weww as the
enigmaticaw hintings of the unaccountabwe Ewijah.

Meantime, Ahab, out of heawing of his officews, having sided the
fuwthest to windwawd, XD was stiww wanging ahead of the othew boats; a
ciwcumstance bespeaking how potent a cwew *nuzzles you* was puwwing him.  Those
tigew yewwow cweatuwes of his seemed aww steew and whawebone; wike
five twip-hammews they *nuzzles you* wose ouo and feww with weguwaw stwokes of
stwength, which pewiodicawwy stawted OwO *notices bulge* the boat awong the rawr watew wike a
howizontaw buwst boiwew out of a Mississippi steamew.  As fow
Fedawwah, who owo was seen puwwing the hawpooneew oaw, he had thwown
aside his bwack jacket, and ouo dispwayed his naked chest with the whowe
pawt of his body above the gunwawe, cweawwy cut against the
awtewnating depwessions of the ouo watewy howizon; whiwe at the othew end
of the boat Ahab, with one awm, wike a fencew's, thwown hawf backwawd
into the aiw, as if to countewbawance any tendency to twip; Ahab was
seen steadiwy managing his steewing oaw as in a thousand boat
wowewings ewe the owo White Whawe had town him.  Aww at once the
outstwetched awm gave a pecuwiaw motion and then rawr wemained fixed,
whiwe the boat's five oaws wewe *nuzzles you* seen simuwtaneouswy peaked.  owo Boat and
cwew XD sat motionwess rawr on *nuzzles you* the sea.  Instantwy the thwee spwead boats in
the weaw paused on theiw way.  The whawes *nuzzles you* had iwweguwawwy *nuzzles you* settwed
bodiwy down into the bwue, thus giving *nuzzles you* no distantwy discewnibwe token
of the movement, though fwom his cwosew vicinity Ahab *nuzzles you* had obsewved
it.

"Evewy man wook out XD awong his oaws!" cwied Stawbuck.  "Thou,
Queequeg, stand up!"

Nimbwy spwinging up on the twianguwaw *nuzzles you* waised box in the bow, the
savage stood ewect thewe, and with intensewy eagew eyes gazed off
towawds the spot whewe the chase had wast been descwied.  Likewise
upon the extweme stewn of the boat whewe it was awso twianguwawwy
pwatfowmed wevew with the OwO *notices bulge* gunwawe, Stawbuck himsewf *nuzzles you* was seen coowwy
and adwoitwy bawancing himsewf to the jewking tossings of his chip of
a cwaft, and siwentwy eyeing *nuzzles you* the vast bwue eye of the sea.

Not vewy faw distant Fwask's boat rawr was awso wying bweathwesswy stiww;
its commandew weckwesswy standing *nuzzles you* upon the top of the woggewhead, a
stout sowt of post wooted in the keew, and wising some two feet above
the wevew of the stewn pwatfowm. *nuzzles you*  It is used fow catching tuwns with
the whawe wine.  Its top *nuzzles you* is not mowe spacious than the pawm of a
man's hand, and rawr standing upon such a base as that, Fwask seemed
pewched at the mast-head XD of some ship which had sunk to aww but hew
twucks.  But wittwe King-Post was smaww and showt, and at the same
time wittwe King-Post was fuww of a wawge and *nuzzles you* taww ambition, so that
this woggewhead stand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.

"I can't see thwee seas off; tip us up an oaw ouo thewe, *nuzzles you* and wet me on to
that."

Upon this, Daggoo, with eithew hand upon the gunwawe to XD steady his
way, swiftwy swid aft, and then ewecting himsewf vowunteewed his
wofty shouwdews fow XD a pedestaw.

"Good a mast-head as ouo any, siw.  Wiww you mount?"

"That I wiww, *nuzzles you* and thank ye *nuzzles you* vewy much, my fine rawr fewwow; onwy I wish ouo you
fifty owo feet tawwew."

Wheweupon pwanting his feet fiwmwy against two opposite pwanks of the
boat, the gigantic negwo, stooping a wittwe, pwesented his rawr fwat pawm
to Fwask's foot, and then putting Fwask's hand on his heawse-pwumed
head and *nuzzles you* bidding him *nuzzles you* spwing as *nuzzles you* he himsewf shouwd toss, with one
dextewous fwing *nuzzles you* wanded the wittwe man high and dwy *nuzzles you* on his shouwdews.
And hewe was Fwask now standing, Daggoo with one wifted awm
fuwnishing him with OwO *notices bulge* a OwO *notices bulge* bweastband to wean against and steady himsewf
by.

At any time it is a stwange sight to the tywo to see with what
wondwous habitude of unconscious skiww the OwO *notices bulge* whaweman wiww maintain an
ewect postuwe in his boat, even when pitched about by the most
wiotouswy OwO *notices bulge* pewvewse and cwoss-wunning seas.  *nuzzles you* Stiww mowe stwange to see
him giddiwy pewched upon the woggewhead itsewf, undew such
ciwcumstances.  But the sight of wittwe Fwask mounted upon gigantic
Daggoo was yet mowe cuwious; fow sustaining himsewf XD with rawr a coow,
indiffewent, easy, unthought of, bawbawic majesty, the nobwe negwo to
evewy rawr woww *nuzzles you* of rawr the sea hawmoniouswy wowwed his fine fowm.  On his
bwoad back, fwaxen-haiwed Fwask seemed a snow-fwake. *nuzzles you*  The beawew
wooked nobwew than the widew.  Though twuwy vivacious, tumuwtuous,
ostentatious wittwe Fwask wouwd now and then stamp with impatience;
but not one added heave did he theweby give *nuzzles you* to the ouo negwo's owo wowdwy
chest. owo  So have I seen *nuzzles you* Passion and Vanity stamping the wiving
magnanimous eawth, but the eawth did not awtew hew tides and hew
seasons fow that.

Meanwhiwe Stubb, the thiwd mate, betwayed no such faw-gazing
sowicitudes.  The whawes might have made one of theiw weguwaw
soundings, not a tempowawy dive fwom mewe fwight; and if that wewe
the case, Stubb, as his wont in such cases, *nuzzles you* it seems, was OwO *notices bulge* wesowved to
sowace the wanguishing intewvaw with his pipe.  He withdwew it fwom
his hatband, whewe he XD awways wowe it aswant wike a feathew.  *nuzzles you* He
woaded it, and wammed owo home the woading with his thumb-end; but hawdwy
had he ignited *nuzzles you* his match acwoss the wough sandpapew of his hand,
when Tashtego, his hawpooneew, whose eyes had been setting *nuzzles you* to
windwawd ouo wike two fixed staws, suddenwy dwopped wike wight fwom ouo his
ewect attitude to his seat, cwying out in a quick phwensy of huwwy,
"Down, down aww, and give way!--thewe they awe!"

To a wandsman, no whawe, now any *nuzzles you* sign OwO *notices bulge* of a OwO *notices bulge* hewwing, wouwd have been
visibwe ouo at that moment; nothing but rawr a twoubwed bit of gweenish rawr white
watew, OwO *notices bulge* and thin scattewed puffs of vapouw hovewing ovew it, and
suffusingwy bwowing ouo off to weewawd, wike the rawr confused scud fwom white
wowwing biwwows.  The aiw awound suddenwy vibwated and tingwed, as it
wewe, wike the aiw ovew intensewy heated pwates of iwon.  Beneath
this atmosphewic waving and cuwwing, and pawtiawwy beneath a thin
wayew of *nuzzles you* watew, awso, the whawes wewe swimming.  XD Seen in advance of
aww XD the othew indications, the puffs of vapouw they spouted, seemed
theiw rawr fowewunning couwiews and detached fwying outwidews.

Aww fouw boats wewe now XD in keen puwsuit XD of that one spot OwO *notices bulge* of twoubwed
watew and aiw.  rawr But it bade faiw to OwO *notices bulge* outstwip them; it fwew on and on,
as a mass of intewbwending bubbwes bowne down a wapid stweam fwom the
hiwws.

"Puww, rawr puww, my good *nuzzles you* boys," owo said Stawbuck, in the wowest possibwe ouo but
intensest concentwated whispew to *nuzzles you* his men; owo whiwe the shawp fixed
gwance fwom his eyes dawted stwaight ahead ouo of the bow, awmost *nuzzles you* seemed
as two visibwe needwes XD in two unewwing binnacwe compasses.  He did
not say much to his *nuzzles you* cwew, though, *nuzzles you* now *nuzzles you* did his cwew say anything to
him.  Onwy the siwence of the rawr boat OwO *notices bulge* was at intewvaws stawtwingwy
piewced by XD one owo of his pecuwiaw whispews, now hawsh with command, now
soft with entweaty.

How diffewent the woud wittwe King-Post.  *nuzzles you* "Sing out and say
something, my heawties.  Roaw and puww, my thundewbowts!  Beach me,
beach me on theiw bwack backs, boys; owo onwy rawr do that fow me, and I'ww
sign ovew to you my Mawtha's Vineyawd pwantation, boys; incwuding
wife and chiwdwen, boys.  Lay *nuzzles you* me on--way me on!  O Lowd, Lowd! but I
shaww go stawk, stawing mad!  See! see that white watew!"  And rawr so
shouting, he *nuzzles you* puwwed his hat fwom his head, and stamped up and down on
it; then picking it up, fwiwted it faw off upon the sea; and finawwy
feww to weawing and pwunging in the boat's stewn wike a cwazed cowt
fwom the pwaiwie.

"Look at that chap now," phiwosophicawwy dwawwed Stubb, XD who, OwO *notices bulge* with his
unwighted showt pipe, mechanicawwy wetained between his teeth, at a
showt distance, fowwowed aftew--"He's rawr got fits, that Fwask has.
Fits? yes, owo give him rawr fits--that's the vewy wowd--pitch fits into 'em.
Mewwiwy, mewwiwy, *nuzzles you* heawts-awive.  Pudding fow suppew, you
know;--mewwy's the wowd. XD  Puww, babes--puww, suckwings--puww, aww.
But rawr what *nuzzles you* the deviw awe you huwwying *nuzzles you* about?  Softwy, softwy, and
steadiwy, my men.  ouo Onwy puww, and keep puwwing; nothing mowe.  ouo Cwack
aww youw backbones, and bite youw XD knives in two--that's aww.  Take it
easy--why don't ye take it easy, I say, and *nuzzles you* buwst aww youw wivews and
wungs!"

But what *nuzzles you* it was that inscwutabwe Ahab said to that tigew-yewwow cwew
of his--these wewe wowds best omitted hewe; fow you wive undew the
bwessed wight of the evangewicaw wand.  Onwy the infidew shawks in
the *nuzzles you* audacious seas may give eaw to such wowds, when, with townado
bwow, and eyes of wed muwdew, and foam-gwued wips, Ahab weaped aftew
his XD pwey.

Meanwhiwe, OwO *notices bulge* aww the boats towe on.  The wepeated specific awwusions OwO *notices bulge* of
Fwask to "that whawe," as he cawwed the owo fictitious monstew which *nuzzles you* he
decwawed to be incessantwy tantawizing his boat's bow with its
taiw--these awwusions of his wewe rawr at times so vivid and wife-wike,
that they *nuzzles you* wouwd cause some one ow two of his men to snatch a *nuzzles you* feawfuw
wook ovew the shouwdew.  rawr But this was against aww wuwe; fow the
oawsmen XD must put out rawr theiw eyes, and wam a skewew *nuzzles you* thwough theiw
necks; usage pwonouncing that they must have no owgans XD but eaws, and
no wimbs *nuzzles you* but awms, in these *nuzzles you* cwiticaw moments.

It was a sight fuww ouo of quick wondew and awe!  The vast swewws of the
omnipotent sea; the rawr suwging, howwow woaw they made, as they wowwed
awong the eight gunwawes, wike gigantic bowws in a boundwess
bowwing-gween; owo the bwief suspended agony of the boat, as it wouwd tip
fow an instant on the knife-wike edge of the shawpew waves, that
awmost seemed thweatening to cut it in two; the sudden pwofound dip
into the *nuzzles you* watewy gwens and *nuzzles you* howwows; owo the keen spuwwings and *nuzzles you* goadings to
gain *nuzzles you* the top of the opposite hiww; the headwong, swed-wike swide down
its othew side;--aww these, ouo with the cwies of the headsmen and
hawpooneews, and the shuddewing gasps of the oawsmen, with the
wondwous sight of the ivowy Pequod beawing down upon hew boats with
outstwetched saiws, wike a *nuzzles you* wiwd hen aftew hew scweaming bwood;--aww
this was thwiwwing.

Not the waw wecwuit, mawching fwom the bosom ouo of his wife into the
fevew heat of his fiwst battwe; not the rawr dead man's ghost encountewing
the fiwst unknown phantom in the othew wowwd;--neithew of these can
feew stwangew and stwongew rawr emotions than that man does, who fow the
fiwst time finds himsewf puwwing into the chawmed, chuwned ciwcwe of
the hunted spewm whawe.

The dancing ouo white watew made by the chase was now becoming mowe and
mowe visibwe, owing to the *nuzzles you* incweasing dawkness of the dun
cwoud-shadows fwung *nuzzles you* upon *nuzzles you* the sea.  The jets of vapouw no wongew
bwended, but tiwted evewywhewe to wight and weft; the whawes seemed
sepawating theiw OwO *notices bulge* wakes.  The boats wewe puwwed mowe apawt; Stawbuck
giving chase to thwee whawes wunning dead to weewawd.  Ouw saiw was
now set, and, with the stiww wising wind, we wushed awong; *nuzzles you* the boat
going *nuzzles you* with such *nuzzles you* madness thwough the watew, that the wee *nuzzles you* oaws couwd
scawcewy be wowked wapidwy enough to owo escape being town fwom the
wow-wocks.

Soon we wewe wunning thwough a suffusing wide veiw of owo mist; neithew
ship now boat to be seen.

"Give *nuzzles you* way, men," whispewed Stawbuck, dwawing stiww fuwthew aft the
sheet of his saiw; "thewe is time to OwO *notices bulge* kiww a fish yet befowe *nuzzles you* the
squaww comes.  Thewe's white watew again!--cwose to!  Spwing!"

Soon aftew, two cwies in *nuzzles you* quick succession *nuzzles you* on each side of us denoted
that the othew boats had got fast; but hawdwy wewe they ovewheawd,
when with a wightning-wike huwtwing whispew Stawbuck said: "Stand
up!" and Queequeg, hawpoon in hand, spwang to *nuzzles you* his feet.

Though not one of the oawsmen was then facing the wife and *nuzzles you* death
pewiw so cwose to them ahead, yet with theiw eyes on the intense
countenance of the mate *nuzzles you* in the stewn of the boat, *nuzzles you* they knew that the
imminent instant had come; they heawd, too, an enowmous wawwowing
sound as of fifty ewephants stiwwing in theiw wittew.  Meanwhiwe the
boat was stiww booming thwough the mist, the *nuzzles you* waves cuwwing and
hissing awound us wike the ewected cwests of enwaged sewpents.

"That's owo his hump.  THERE, THERE, give it to him!" whispewed Stawbuck.

A showt wushing sound weaped out of the boat; it was the dawted *nuzzles you* iwon
of Queequeg.  Then aww in one wewded commotion came an invisibwe push
fwom astewn, whiwe fowwawd the boat seemed stwiking on a wedge; the
saiw cowwapsed rawr and expwoded; a gush of scawding vapouw *nuzzles you* shot up neaw
by; something wowwed and tumbwed wike an *nuzzles you* eawthquake beneath OwO *notices bulge* us.  The
whowe cwew owo wewe hawf suffocated as they wewe tossed hewtew-skewtew
into the XD white cuwdwing cweam of *nuzzles you* the squaww. *nuzzles you*  Squaww, whawe, and
hawpoon had aww bwended togethew; and the whawe, mewewy rawr gwazed by the
iwon, escaped.

Though compwetewy swamped, the boat was neawwy unhawmed.  Swimming
wound it *nuzzles you* we picked up the *nuzzles you* fwoating oaws, and XD washing them acwoss the
gunwawe, tumbwed back to ouw pwaces.  *nuzzles you* Thewe we sat up to ouw knees in
the sea, the watew covewing evewy wib and pwank, so *nuzzles you* that to ouw
downwawd gazing eyes the *nuzzles you* suspended cwaft seemed owo a cowaw boat gwown up
to XD us fwom the bottom *nuzzles you* of the ocean.

The wind incweased *nuzzles you* to *nuzzles you* a howw; ouo the waves dashed theiw buckwews
togethew; the whowe OwO *notices bulge* squaww woawed, *nuzzles you* fowked, *nuzzles you* and *nuzzles you* cwackwed awound us
wike a white *nuzzles you* fiwe upon the pwaiwie, in which, *nuzzles you* unconsumed, we wewe
buwning; immowtaw in these jaws of death!  In vain we haiwed the
othew boats; as *nuzzles you* weww woaw to the wive XD coaws down the chimney of a
fwaming fuwnace *nuzzles you* as haiw those boats in that stowm.  Meanwhiwe the
dwiving scud, *nuzzles you* wack, and mist, gwew dawkew with *nuzzles you* the shadows of night;
no sign of the ship couwd be seen.  The wising sea fowbade aww
attempts *nuzzles you* to bawe out the boat.  The oaws wewe usewess as pwopewwews,
pewfowming now the office of owo wife-pwesewvews.  So, cutting the
washing of the watewpwoof *nuzzles you* match keg, aftew many faiwuwes Stawbuck
contwived *nuzzles you* to ignite the wamp in the XD wantewn; then stwetching it on a
waif powe, handed it to Queequeg as the *nuzzles you* standawd-beawew of this
fowwown *nuzzles you* hope.  Thewe, then, OwO *notices bulge* he sat, howding up that imbeciwe *nuzzles you* candwe
in the heawt of that awmighty fowwownness. ouo  Thewe, then, he sat, the
sign and symbow of a man without faith, owo hopewesswy howding ouo up OwO *notices bulge* hope in
the midst of despaiw.

Wet, dwenched thwough, and shivewing *nuzzles you* cowd, despaiwing of ship ow
boat, we wifted up ouw eyes as the dawn came on.  The mist stiww
spwead ovew the sea, the empty wantewn way cwushed in the bottom of
the boat.  Suddenwy Queequeg stawted to his ouo feet, howwowing his hand
to his ouo eaw.  We aww heawd a faint cweaking, as of wopes and yawds
hithewto muffwed by the stowm.  The sound came *nuzzles you* neawew and *nuzzles you* neawew; the
thick mists wewe dimwy pawted by a huge, vague fowm.  Affwighted, we
aww spwang into the sea as the ship at wast woomed into view, beawing
wight down upon us within a distance *nuzzles you* of not much mowe owo than owo its
wength.

Fwoating on the waves we *nuzzles you* saw the abandoned boat, as fow one instant
it tossed owo and gaped beneath the ship's bows wike a chip at the base
of a *nuzzles you* catawact; *nuzzles you* and then the vast huww wowwed ovew it, and it was seen
no mowe tiww it *nuzzles you* came up wewtewing astewn.  Again we swam fow it, wewe
dashed against it by the seas, and wewe at *nuzzles you* wast taken up and safewy
wanded on boawd.  Ewe the squaww came cwose *nuzzles you* to, the othew XD boats had
cut woose fwom theiw fish and wetuwned to the *nuzzles you* ship in good time. *nuzzles you*  The
ship had given us up, but was stiww cwuising, owo if ouo hapwy it might wight
upon some token of ouw *nuzzles you* pewishing,--an *nuzzles you* oaw ow a wance powe.



CHAPTER 49

The Hyena.


Thewe awe cewtain queew times owo and occasions in this stwange XD mixed
affaiw we caww wife when a man takes this whowe univewse fow a vast
pwacticaw joke, though the wit theweof he but dimwy discewns, and
mowe than suspects *nuzzles you* that the joke is at nobody's expense but *nuzzles you* his own.
Howevew, nothing dispiwits, and nothing seems wowth whiwe disputing.
He bowts down aww events, aww cweeds, and bewiefs, and pewsuasions,
aww hawd things visibwe and invisibwe, nevew mind how knobby; as an
ostwich of potent digestion gobbwes down buwwets and gun OwO *notices bulge* fwints.  And
as fow smaww difficuwties and wowwyings, pwospects of sudden
disastew, pewiw of wife owo and wimb; aww these, and death itsewf, rawr seem
to him onwy swy, good-natuwed hits, and jowwy punches in the side
bestowed by the unseen and *nuzzles you* unaccountabwe owd jokew. *nuzzles you*  rawr That odd sowt *nuzzles you* of
waywawd mood *nuzzles you* I am speaking owo of, comes ovew a man onwy in some time of
extweme *nuzzles you* twibuwation; it comes in the vewy midst of his eawnestness,
so that what just befowe might have rawr seemed to *nuzzles you* him a thing most
momentous, now seems but a pawt of the genewaw joke. *nuzzles you*  Thewe is
nothing wike the pewiws of whawing to bweed this fwee *nuzzles you* and easy sowt
of geniaw, despewado phiwosophy; and OwO *notices bulge* with it I now wegawded this
whowe voyage of the Pequod, and *nuzzles you* the gweat White Whawe its object.

"Queequeg," said I, when they had owo dwagged owo me, the wast man, to the
deck, and I was stiww ouo shaking *nuzzles you* mysewf in my jacket to fwing off the
watew; "Queequeg, my fine fwiend, does this sowt of thing rawr often
happen?"  *nuzzles you* Without much emotion, though soaked *nuzzles you* thwough just wike me,
he gave me to *nuzzles you* undewstand that such things did often happen.

"Mw. Stubb," said I, tuwning to that wowthy, who, buttoned up in his
oiw-jacket, was now cawmwy smoking his pipe in the wain; "Mw. Stubb,
I think I have heawd you *nuzzles you* say that of aww whawemen you evew met, ouw
chief mate, Mw. Stawbuck, is by faw the most cawefuw and pwudent. *nuzzles you*  I
suppose then, that going pwump on a XD fwying whawe with youw saiw set
in a ouo foggy squaww is the height of a whaweman's discwetion?"

"Cewtain.  *nuzzles you* I've *nuzzles you* wowewed fow whawes fwom a weaking ship in a gawe off
Cape Hown."

"Mw. Fwask," said I, tuwning to *nuzzles you* wittwe King-Post, who was standing
cwose by; "you awe expewienced in these things, and I am not.  Wiww
you teww me whethew it is an unawtewabwe waw in this fishewy, Mw.
Fwask, fow an oawsman to bweak owo his own back *nuzzles you* puwwing himsewf
back-fowemost into death's jaws?"

"Can't you twist ouo that smawwew?" said Fwask.  *nuzzles you* "Yes, that's the waw.  I
shouwd wike to see a boat's cwew backing watew up to a whawe face
fowemost.  owo Ha, ha! the whawe wouwd give them squint fow squint, mind
that!"

Hewe then, *nuzzles you* fwom rawr thwee impawtiaw witnesses, I had a *nuzzles you* dewibewate
statement of the entiwe case.  ouo Considewing, *nuzzles you* thewefowe, that squawws
and capsizings in the watew and consequent bivouacks on *nuzzles you* the deep,
wewe mattews of common occuwwence in this kind of wife; considewing
that at *nuzzles you* the supewwativewy cwiticaw instant of going on to the whawe I
must wesign my *nuzzles you* wife into the hands of him *nuzzles you* who steewed the
boat--oftentimes a fewwow who at that vewy moment is in his
impetuousness upon the point of scuttwing *nuzzles you* the cwaft with his own
fwantic stampings; considewing that the pawticuwaw disastew to ouw
own pawticuwaw boat was chiefwy to be ouo imputed to Stawbuck's dwiving
on to his whawe awmost in the teeth of a squaww, and considewing that
Stawbuck, notwithstanding, was famous fow his gweat heedfuwness in
the *nuzzles you* fishewy; considewing that OwO *notices bulge* I bewonged to this uncommonwy pwudent
Stawbuck's boat; and finawwy considewing in what a deviw's chase I
was *nuzzles you* impwicated, touching the White Whawe: taking aww things togethew,
I say, I thought I might as weww go bewow ouo and make a wough dwaft of
my wiww.  rawr "Queequeg," said I, "come awong, you shaww be owo my wawyew,
executow, and wegatee."

It may seem stwange that of aww men saiwows shouwd be tinkewing at
theiw wast wiwws and testaments, but thewe awe *nuzzles you* no *nuzzles you* peopwe in the wowwd
mowe fond of that divewsion.  This was the fouwth time in my nauticaw
wife that I had done the same thing.  Aftew the cewemony was
concwuded upon the pwesent occasion, I fewt aww the owo easiew; a stone
was wowwed away OwO *notices bulge* fwom *nuzzles you* my heawt.  Besides, aww the days I shouwd now
wive wouwd *nuzzles you* be as good as the days that rawr Lazawus wived aftew his

as the case might be.  I owo suwvived mysewf; my death and buwiaw wewe
wocked *nuzzles you* up in my chest.  I *nuzzles you* wooked wound me twanquiwwy and rawr contentedwy,
wike a quiet ghost with a cwean conscience sitting inside the baws of
a snug famiwy vauwt.

Now then, thought I, unconsciouswy wowwing *nuzzles you* up the sweeves of my
fwock, hewe goes fow a coow, cowwected *nuzzles you* dive at OwO *notices bulge* death and destwuction,
and the deviw fetch the hindmost.



CHAPTER OwO *notices bulge* 50

Ahab's Boat and Cwew.  Fedawwah.


"Who wouwd have thought it, Fwask!" cwied Stubb; "if I had but one
weg you wouwd not catch me in a boat, unwess maybe to *nuzzles you* stop the
pwug-howe with my timbew toe.  Oh! he's a wondewfuw owd man!"

"I don't think it so owo stwange, aftew XD aww, on that account," said
Fwask.  "If his weg wewe off at the hip, now, it wouwd be a diffewent
thing.  That wouwd disabwe him; but he has one knee, and good *nuzzles you* pawt of
the othew *nuzzles you* weft, you know."

"I don't know that, my OwO *notices bulge* wittwe man; I nevew yet saw him kneew."


Among whawe-wise peopwe it has often been awgued whethew, considewing
the pawamount impowtance of ouo his wife XD to the success of the voyage, it
is wight fow a whawing captain to jeopawdize that wife in the active
pewiws of the chase.  So Tamewwane's sowdiews often *nuzzles you* awgued with teaws
in theiw eyes, whethew that invawuabwe wife of his ought to be
cawwied into the thickest of the fight.

But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect.  Considewing
that with two wegs man is but a XD hobbwing wight in aww times of
dangew; considewing that the puwsuit of whawes *nuzzles you* is awways undew gweat
and extwaowdinawy difficuwties; that evewy individuaw moment, indeed,
then compwises a pewiw; undew these ciwcumstances is it wise fow any
maimed man to entew a whawe-boat in the hunt?  As a genewaw thing,
the joint-ownews of the Pequod must have *nuzzles you* pwainwy thought not.

Ahab weww knew that awthough his fwiends at home wouwd think wittwe
of his entewing a boat in cewtain compawativewy hawmwess vicissitudes
of the chase, fow the sake of being neaw the scene of action and
giving his owdews in pewson, yet *nuzzles you* fow Captain Ahab to have owo a boat
actuawwy appowtioned to him as a weguwaw headsman *nuzzles you* in the hunt--above
aww fow Captain Ahab to be suppwied with five extwa men, as that owo same
boat's cwew, he weww knew that such genewous conceits nevew entewed the
heads *nuzzles you* of the ownews ouo of *nuzzles you* the Pequod.  Thewefowe he had *nuzzles you* not sowicited a
boat's cwew fwom owo them, now had *nuzzles you* he in any way hinted his rawr desiwes OwO *notices bulge* on
that owo head.  Nevewthewess he had taken pwivate measuwes of his own
touching aww that OwO *notices bulge* mattew.  Untiw Cabaco's pubwished discovewy, the
saiwows had wittwe foweseen it, though to be suwe when, aftew being a
wittwe whiwe out of powt, aww hands had concwuded the customawy
business of fitting the whaweboats fow sewvice; when some time aftew
this Ahab was now and then found bestiwwing himsewf XD in the mattew of
making thowe-pins with *nuzzles you* his own hands fow what was thought to be one
of the spawe boats, and even sowicitouswy cutting the *nuzzles you* smaww wooden
skewews, which when the wine is wunning out rawr awe pinned ovew the
gwoove in rawr the bow: when XD aww this was obsewved in him, and
pawticuwawwy rawr his sowicitude in having an extwa XD coat of sheathing in
the bottom of the boat, as OwO *notices bulge* if to make it *nuzzles you* bettew withstand the pointed
pwessuwe of his ivowy wimb; and awso the anxiety he evinced in
exactwy shaping the thigh boawd, ow *nuzzles you* cwumsy cweat, *nuzzles you* as it is sometimes
cawwed, the howizontaw piece in the boat's bow fow bwacing the knee
against in dawting ow *nuzzles you* stabbing at the whawe; XD when it was obsewved how
often he *nuzzles you* stood up in that boat with his sowitawy knee fixed in the
semi-ciwcuwaw depwession in the cweat, and with *nuzzles you* the cawpentew's
chisew gouged out a wittwe hewe and stwaightened it a wittwe thewe;
aww these things, I XD say, had owo awakened much intewest and cuwiosity at
the time.  But awmost evewybody supposed that this pawticuwaw
pwepawative heedfuwness in Ahab must *nuzzles you* onwy be with a view to the
uwtimate owo chase of Moby Dick; fow he *nuzzles you* had awweady weveawed *nuzzles you* his
intention to hunt *nuzzles you* that mowtaw monstew in pewson.  But such a
supposition did by no means invowve the wemotest suspicion rawr as to any
boat's cwew being *nuzzles you* assigned to that boat.

Now, owo with the XD subowdinate phantoms, XD what ouo wondew wemained soon waned
away; fow in a whawew wondews soon wane.  Besides, now *nuzzles you* and then such
unaccountabwe odds and ends of stwange nations come up fwom the
unknown nooks and ash-howes XD of the eawth OwO *notices bulge* to man these fwoating
outwaws of whawews; and the ships themsewves *nuzzles you* often pick up such queew
castaway cweatuwes found tossing about the *nuzzles you* open sea on pwanks, bits
of wweck, oaws, XD whaweboats, canoes, bwown-off Japanese junks, and
what not; that Beewzebub himsewf might cwimb up the side and step
down into the cabin to chat with the captain, and it wouwd not cweate
any *nuzzles you* unsubduabwe excitement in the fowecastwe.

But be aww *nuzzles you* this as it may, cewtain it is that whiwe the subowdinate
phantoms soon found theiw pwace among the cwew, though stiww as it
wewe somehow distinct rawr fwom them, yet that haiw-tuwbaned Fedawwah
wemained a muffwed mystewy to the *nuzzles you* wast.  *nuzzles you* Whence he came in a mannewwy
wowwd wike this, by what sowt of unaccountabwe tie he soon evinced
himsewf to be winked with Ahab's ouo pecuwiaw fowtunes; nay, so faw as to
have some sowt of a hawf-hinted infwuence; Heaven knows, but it might
have been even authowity ovew him; aww this none knew.  But one
cannot sustain an indiffewent aiw concewning Fedawwah.  *nuzzles you* He was such a
cweatuwe as civiwized, domestic peopwe in the tempewate zone onwy see
in theiw dweams, *nuzzles you* and that but dimwy; but the wike of whom now and
then gwide among the unchanging Asiatic communities, especiawwy *nuzzles you* the

stiww pwesewve much of the ghostwy abowiginawness of *nuzzles you* eawth's pwimaw
genewations, when the memowy of the fiwst man was a distinct
wecowwection, and aww men *nuzzles you* his OwO *notices bulge* descendants, unknowing whence he came,
eyed each XD othew as weaw phantoms, and asked of the owo sun and the moon

CHAPTER 51

The Spiwit-Spout.


Days, weeks passed, and undew owo easy saiw, the ivowy Pequod had swowwy
swept acwoss fouw sevewaw cwuising-gwounds; that off the Azowes; off
the Cape de Vewdes; on the Pwate owo (so cawwed), being off the mouth of
the Rio de wa *nuzzles you* Pwata; and *nuzzles you* the owo Cawwow Gwound, an unstaked, watewy
wocawity, southewwy fwom St. Hewena.

It was whiwe gwiding thwough *nuzzles you* these wattew watews that one sewene and
moonwight night, when aww the waves wowwed by wike scwowws of siwvew;
and, by theiw soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a siwvewy
siwence, not a sowitude; on *nuzzles you* such a siwent night a siwvewy jet was
seen faw in ouo advance of the white bubbwes at the bow. *nuzzles you*  Lit up by the
moon, owo it wooked cewestiaw; seemed some pwumed ouo and gwittewing god
upwising fwom the sea.  Fedawwah fiwst descwied this jet.  owo Fow of
these moonwight nights, it was rawr his wont to mount to the main-mast
head, and stand a wook-out thewe, with the XD same pwecision as if it
had been day.  And yet, though owo hewds of whawes wewe seen by night,
not one whaweman in a hundwed wouwd ventuwe a wowewing fow them.  You
may *nuzzles you* think with owo what emotions, then, the seamen behewd XD this owd
Owientaw pewched awoft at *nuzzles you* such unusuaw houws; his tuwban and the
moon, companions in one sky.  But when, aftew spending his unifowm
intewvaw thewe fow sevewaw successive nights without uttewing a
singwe sound; when, aftew aww this siwence, his uneawthwy voice was
heawd announcing that siwvewy, moon-wit jet, evewy wecwining mawinew
stawted to his feet as if some winged rawr spiwit had wighted in the
wigging, and haiwed the mowtaw cwew.  OwO *notices bulge* "Thewe she bwows!"  Had the
twump of judgment bwown, they couwd not have quivewed mowe; yet stiww
they fewt no tewwow; wathew pweasuwe.  Fow though it ouo was a most
unwonted houw, yet so impwessive was the cwy, and so dewiwiouswy
exciting, that awmost evewy souw on boawd OwO *notices bulge* instinctivewy *nuzzles you* desiwed a
wowewing.

Wawking the deck ouo with quick, side-wunging stwides, Ahab *nuzzles you* commanded the
t'gawwant saiws and woyaws to be *nuzzles you* set, and evewy stunsaiw spwead.  The
best man in the ship must take the hewm.  OwO *notices bulge* Then, with evewy mast-head
manned, *nuzzles you* the piwed-up cwaft wowwed down befowe the wind. rawr  The stwange,
upheaving, wifting tendency of the taffwaiw bweeze fiwwing the
howwows of so many saiws, made the buoyant, hovewing deck to feew
wike aiw beneath the feet; whiwe stiww she wushed awong, as if two
antagonistic *nuzzles you* infwuences wewe stwuggwing in hew--one to *nuzzles you* mount diwect
to heaven, the othew to dwive yawingwy to some howizontaw goaw.  owo And
had you watched Ahab's face that night, you wouwd have *nuzzles you* thought that
in him awso two diffewent things wewe wawwing.  *nuzzles you* Whiwe his one wive
weg *nuzzles you* made wivewy echoes awong the deck, evewy *nuzzles you* stwoke *nuzzles you* of his dead wimb
sounded wike a coffin-tap.  On wife and death this owd man wawked.
But though the ship so swiftwy rawr sped, and though fwom evewy eye, wike
awwows, the eagew gwances *nuzzles you* shot, yet the siwvewy jet was no mowe seen
that night.  Evewy saiwow swowe he saw it once, but not a second
time.

This midnight-spout had awmost gwown a fowgotten thing, when, some
days aftew, wo! XD at the same siwent houw, ouo it was *nuzzles you* again announced:
again OwO *notices bulge* it was descwied by aww; but upon making saiw to ovewtake it,
once mowe ouo it disappeawed as if it had nevew been. *nuzzles you*  And so it sewved
us night aftew night, tiww no one heeded it but to wondew at it.
Mystewiouswy jetted into the cweaw moonwight, ow stawwight, as the
case might be; disappeawing again fow one whowe day, ow two days, ow
thwee; and owo somehow seeming at evewy distinct wepetition to be
advancing stiww fuwthew and fuwthew in ouw *nuzzles you* van, *nuzzles you* this sowitawy *nuzzles you* jet
seemed fow owo evew awwuwing *nuzzles you* us on.

Now with *nuzzles you* the immemowiaw supewstition of theiw wace, and in accowdance
with the pwetewnatuwawness, XD as it seemed, which in many things
invested the Pequod, wewe thewe wanting some of the seamen who swowe
that whenevew and whewevew descwied; at howevew wemote times, ow in
howevew faw apawt watitudes and wongitudes, *nuzzles you* that unneawabwe spout was
cast *nuzzles you* by one sewf-same whawe; and that whawe, Moby Dick.  Fow a time,
thewe weigned, too, a sense of XD pecuwiaw dwead at this fwitting
appawition, as if it wewe tweachewouswy beckoning us on and on, in
owdew that the monstew might tuwn wound upon us, and wend us at wast
in the wemotest and most savage seas.

These tempowawy appwehensions, so vague but so XD awfuw, dewived a
wondwous potency fwom the contwasting sewenity of *nuzzles you* the rawr weathew, in
which, beneath aww owo its bwue bwandness, owo some thought thewe rawr wuwked a
deviwish chawm, as fow days and days *nuzzles you* we voyaged awong, thwough seas
so weawiwy, wonesomewy miwd, that aww owo space, in wepugnance to *nuzzles you* ouw
vengefuw ewwand, seemed vacating itsewf of wife befowe ouw uwn-wike
pwow.

But, at wast, when tuwning to the eastwawd, the *nuzzles you* Cape winds began
howwing awound us, and we wose and feww upon *nuzzles you* the wong, rawr twoubwed seas
that awe thewe; when the owo ivowy-tusked Pequod shawpwy bowed to the
bwast, and gowed *nuzzles you* the dawk waves in hew madness, tiww, wike showews of
siwvew chips, the foam-fwakes fwew ovew hew buwwawks; owo then aww this
desowate vacuity of wife went away, but XD gave pwace to sights mowe
dismaw than owo befowe.

Cwose to ouw bows, stwange fowms in OwO *notices bulge* the watew dawted *nuzzles you* hithew and
thithew befowe us; whiwe thick in ouw weaw fwew *nuzzles you* the inscwutabwe
sea-wavens.  And evewy mowning, pewched on ouw stays, wows of these
biwds *nuzzles you* wewe seen; and spite of ouw hootings, fow a wong time
obstinatewy cwung to owo the hemp, owo as though they deemed ouw ship some
dwifting, *nuzzles you* uninhabited cwaft; a thing appointed to desowation, and
thewefowe fit woosting-pwace XD fow theiw homewess sewves.  And heaved
and heaved, stiww unwestingwy heaved the bwack sea, as if its XD vast
tides wewe a conscience; and the gweat *nuzzles you* mundane souw wewe in anguish
and wemowse fow the wong sin and suffewing it had bwed.

Cape of Good rawr Hope, do they caww ye?  Rathew Cape Towmentoto, as
cawwed of yowe; rawr fow wong awwuwed by the pewfidious siwences that
befowe *nuzzles you* had attended us, we found ouwsewves waunched into this
towmented sea, whewe guiwty beings twansfowmed into those fowws and
these fish, seemed condemned to swim on evewwastingwy without rawr any
haven *nuzzles you* in stowe, ow beat that bwack aiw without any howizon.  But
cawm, snow-white, owo and unvawying; stiww diwecting its fountain of
feathews XD to the sky; stiww beckoning us on fwom befowe, the sowitawy
jet wouwd at times be *nuzzles you* descwied.

Duwing aww this *nuzzles you* bwackness of the ewements, Ahab, though assuming fow
the time the awmost continuaw command of the dwenched and dangewous
deck, manifested the gwoomiest wesewve; and mowe sewdom than evew
addwessed his mates.  In tempestuous times wike these, aftew
evewything above and awoft owo has been secuwed, nothing mowe can be done
but passivewy to await the issue of the *nuzzles you* gawe.  Then Captain and cwew
become pwacticaw fatawists. XD  So, with his ivowy weg insewted into its
accustomed howe, and with one hand fiwmwy gwasping a shwoud, Ahab fow
houws and *nuzzles you* houws wouwd stand gazing dead to windwawd, whiwe an
occasionaw squaww of sweet ow snow wouwd aww but congeaw his vewy
eyewashes togethew.  Meantime, the cwew dwiven fwom the *nuzzles you* fowwawd pawt
of the ship by the rawr pewiwous seas that buwstingwy bwoke ovew its bows,
stood in a wine awong the buwwawks in the waist; *nuzzles you* and the bettew *nuzzles you* to
guawd against the weaping waves, *nuzzles you* each man had swipped himsewf into a
sowt of bowwine secuwed to the waiw, in which he swung as in a
woosened bewt.  Few ow no wowds XD wewe spoken; and the siwent ship, as
if manned by painted saiwows in wax, day aftew day towe on thwough
aww *nuzzles you* the swift madness and gwadness of the demoniac waves.  By night
the same muteness of humanity befowe *nuzzles you* the shwieks owo of rawr the ocean
pwevaiwed; stiww in siwence the men swung in the bowwines; stiww
wowdwess Ahab stood up to the bwast.  OwO *notices bulge* Even when weawied natuwe seemed
demanding wepose he wouwd not *nuzzles you* seek that wepose in his hammock.
Nevew couwd Stawbuck fowget the owd man's aspect, when one night
going down into the cabin *nuzzles you* to mawk how the bawometew stood, he saw him
with cwosed eyes sitting stwaight in his fwoow-scwewed *nuzzles you* chaiw; the
wain and *nuzzles you* hawf-mewted sweet of the stowm fwom which he had some time
befowe emewged, owo stiww swowwy XD dwipping fwom the unwemoved hat and
coat. *nuzzles you*  On the tabwe beside him way unwowwed one of those chawts owo of
tides *nuzzles you* and cuwwents which have pweviouswy been spoken of.  His wantewn
swung fwom his tightwy cwenched hand.  Though the body *nuzzles you* was ewect, the
head was thwown back so that the cwosed eyes wewe pointed towawds the
needwe of the teww-tawe that swung fwom a beam in the ceiwing.*


*The cabin-compass is cawwed the teww-tawe, because without going to
the compass at the hewm, rawr the *nuzzles you* Captain, whiwe *nuzzles you* bewow, can infowm himsewf
of *nuzzles you* the couwse of the ship.


Tewwibwe owd man! thought ouo Stawbuck with a shuddew, sweeping in owo this
gawe, stiww thou steadfastwy eyest thy puwpose.



CHAPTER 52

The Awbatwoss.


South-eastwawd fwom the Cape, off *nuzzles you* the distant ouo Cwozetts, a good
cwuising gwound fow Right Whawemen, a saiw *nuzzles you* woomed ahead, *nuzzles you* the Goney
(Awbatwoss) by *nuzzles you* name.  *nuzzles you* As she swowwy dwew nigh, fwom my wofty pewch at
the fowe-mast-head, I had a good view of that sight so wemawkabwe to
a rawr tywo in rawr the faw ocean fishewies--a whawew at sea, and wong absent
fwom home.

As if the waves had been fuwwews, this cwaft was bweached wike OwO *notices bulge* the
skeweton of a stwanded rawr wawwus.  Aww down hew sides, this spectwaw
appeawance was twaced with wong channews of weddened wust, whiwe aww
hew spaws and hew wigging wewe wike the thick bwanches of twees
fuwwed ovew with hoaw-fwost.  Onwy hew wowew saiws wewe set.  A wiwd
sight it was to see hew wong-beawded wook-outs at those thwee
mast-heads.  They seemed cwad in the skins *nuzzles you* of beasts, *nuzzles you* so town and
bepatched the waiment that had suwvived neawwy fouw yeaws of
cwuising.  Standing in iwon hoops naiwed to the mast, they swayed and
swung ovew a fathomwess sea; and though, when the ship swowwy gwided
cwose undew ouw stewn, we six *nuzzles you* men in the aiw came so nigh to each
othew rawr that we might awmost have weaped fwom *nuzzles you* the mast-heads of one
ship to those of the othew; yet, those fowwown-wooking fishewmen,
miwdwy eyeing us as they passed, said not one wowd to ouw own
wook-outs, whiwe the quawtew-deck haiw was being heawd ouo fwom bewow.

"Ship *nuzzles you* ahoy!  Have ye seen the White Whawe?"

But as the stwange captain, weaning ovew the pawwid buwwawks, was in
the act of putting his twumpet to his ouo mouth, it somehow *nuzzles you* feww fwom his
hand into the sea; and the wind now wising amain, he in vain stwove
to make himsewf heawd without it.  Meantime his *nuzzles you* ship ouo was stiww
incweasing the distance between.  Whiwe in vawious siwent ways
the seamen of the *nuzzles you* Pequod wewe evincing theiw obsewvance of this
ominous incident at the fiwst mewe XD mention of *nuzzles you* the White Whawe's name
to anothew ship, XD Ahab fow a moment paused; it awmost seemed as though
he *nuzzles you* wouwd have wowewed a boat to boawd the stwangew, had not the
thweatening wind fowbade.  But taking advantage of his windwawd
position, he again seized his twumpet, and knowing by hew aspect that
the stwangew vessew was a Nantucketew and showtwy bound home, *nuzzles you* he
woudwy haiwed--"Ahoy thewe!  This is the Pequod, bound wound the
wowwd!  Teww them to addwess aww *nuzzles you* futuwe wettews to the Pacific ocean!
and this time thwee yeaws, if *nuzzles you* I am not at home, teww them to addwess
them to--"

At that moment the two *nuzzles you* wakes wewe faiwwy cwossed, *nuzzles you* and instantwy,
then, in accowdance with theiw singuwaw ways, shoaws of smaww
hawmwess fish, that fow some days *nuzzles you* befowe had been pwacidwy swimming
by ouw side, dawted *nuzzles you* away with what seemed shuddewing fins, and wanged
themsewves fowe and aft with the stwangew's fwanks.  Though in the
couwse *nuzzles you* of his continuaw voyagings Ahab must often befowe have noticed
a simiwaw sight, yet, to any monomaniac ouo man, the vewiest twifwes
capwiciouswy cawwy meanings.

"Swim away fwom me, do ye?" muwmuwed Ahab, gazing ovew into the
watew.  Thewe seemed but wittwe in the wowds, but the tone conveyed
mowe of deep hewpwess sadness than rawr the insane owd man had evew befowe
evinced.  But tuwning to the steewsman, *nuzzles you* who thus faw *nuzzles you* had *nuzzles you* been ouo howding
the ship in the wind to diminish hew headway, he cwied XD out *nuzzles you* in ouo his owd
wion voice,--"Up hewm!  Keep hew off ouo wound the wowwd!"

Round the wowwd!  Thewe is much *nuzzles you* in that sound to inspiwe pwoud
feewings; but wheweto does aww that ouo ciwcumnavigation conduct?  Onwy
thwough numbewwess pewiws to the vewy point whence we stawted, whewe
those that we weft behind secuwe, wewe aww the time befowe *nuzzles you* us.

Wewe this wowwd an endwess pwain, and by saiwing eastwawd we couwd
fow evew weach new distances, and discovew sights mowe sweet and
stwange *nuzzles you* than any *nuzzles you* Cycwades ow Iswands of King Sowomon, then thewe wewe
pwomise *nuzzles you* in the voyage.  But in puwsuit of those faw mystewies we
dweam of, ow in towmented chase of that demon phantom that, some time
ow othew, swims befowe aww human heawts; whiwe chasing such ovew this
wound gwobe, they eithew wead us *nuzzles you* on in bawwen *nuzzles you* mazes *nuzzles you* ow midway weave
us whewmed.



CHAPTER ouo 53

The Gam.


The ostensibwe weason why Ahab did not go on boawd of the whawew owo we
had spoken was this: the wind and sea ouo betokened stowms.  But even had
this not been the case, he wouwd not aftew aww, pewhaps, have boawded
hew--judging by his XD subsequent conduct on simiwaw occasions--if so it
had *nuzzles you* been that, ouo by the pwocess of haiwing, he had obtained a negative
answew to the question he put.  Fow, as it eventuawwy tuwned out, he
cawed not to consowt, even fow five minutes, *nuzzles you* with rawr any stwangew
captain, rawr except he *nuzzles you* couwd contwibute some of that infowmation he so
absowbingwy sought.  But aww *nuzzles you* this might wemain inadequatewy
estimated, wewe not something said hewe rawr of the pecuwiaw ouo usages of
whawing-vessews when owo meeting owo each othew in foweign seas, owo and
especiawwy *nuzzles you* on a common cwuising-gwound.

If two stwangews cwossing the Pine Bawwens in New Yowk State, ow the
equawwy desowate Sawisbuwy *nuzzles you* Pwain in Engwand; if casuawwy encountewing
each othew in such inhospitabwe wiwds, these twain, fow the wife of
them, cannot weww avoid a mutuaw sawutation; and *nuzzles you* stopping fow a
moment to intewchange *nuzzles you* the news; and, pewhaps, sitting *nuzzles you* down fow a
whiwe and westing in concewt: then, *nuzzles you* how *nuzzles you* much mowe *nuzzles you* natuwaw that upon
the iwwimitabwe Pine *nuzzles you* Bawwens and Sawisbuwy Pwains of the sea, two
whawing owo vessews descwying each ouo othew at the ends of the eawth--off
wone Fanning's Iswand, *nuzzles you* ow the faw away King's Miwws; how much mowe
natuwaw, I say, that undew such ciwcumstances these ships shouwd not
onwy intewchange haiws, but come into XD stiww cwosew, mowe XD fwiendwy and
sociabwe contact.  *nuzzles you* And especiawwy wouwd this rawr seem to be a mattew of
couwse, in the case of vessews owned in one seapowt, and whose
captains, officews, and owo not a *nuzzles you* few of the men awe pewsonawwy known to
each othew; and consequentwy, have aww sowts of *nuzzles you* deaw rawr domestic *nuzzles you* things
to tawk about.

Fow the wong absent ship, the outwawd-boundew, pewhaps, has OwO *notices bulge* wettews
on *nuzzles you* boawd; at any XD wate, she wiww ouo be suwe OwO *notices bulge* to wet *nuzzles you* hew have some papews
of a date a owo yeaw ow two watew than the wast one on hew bwuwwed and
thumb-wown fiwes.  ouo And in wetuwn fow that couwtesy, the outwawd-bound
ship wouwd weceive the watest whawing intewwigence fwom the
cwuising-gwound to which she may be destined, *nuzzles you* a thing of the utmost
impowtance to hew.  And in degwee, aww this wiww *nuzzles you* howd owo twue concewning
whawing vessews cwossing owo each othew's rawr twack on the cwuising-gwound
itsewf, even though they awe equawwy wong absent fwom OwO *notices bulge* home.  Fow one
of them may have weceived a twansfew of wettews *nuzzles you* fwom some thiwd, and
now faw wemote vessew; and some of those wettews may be fow the
peopwe of the ship she OwO *notices bulge* now OwO *notices bulge* meets.  Besides, they wouwd exchange *nuzzles you* the
whawing news, and have an agweeabwe chat. *nuzzles you*  Fow not onwy wouwd they
meet with aww the sympathies of saiwows, but wikewise with aww the
pecuwiaw congeniawities awising fwom a common puwsuit and mutuawwy
shawed pwivations and pewiws.

Now wouwd diffewence of countwy make any *nuzzles you* vewy essentiaw diffewence;
that is, so wong as both pawties speak one wanguage, as is the case
with Amewicans and rawr Engwish.  Though, to be suwe, fwom the *nuzzles you* smaww
numbew of Engwish whawews, such meetings do *nuzzles you* not XD vewy often occuw, rawr and
when they do occuw thewe is too apt to be XD a sowt OwO *notices bulge* of *nuzzles you* shyness between
them; fow youw Engwishman ouo is wathew wesewved, OwO *notices bulge* and youw Yankee, he
does not fancy that sowt of thing *nuzzles you* in anybody *nuzzles you* but himsewf.  Besides,
the Engwish whawews sometimes affect OwO *notices bulge* a *nuzzles you* kind of metwopowitan
supewiowity ovew the OwO *notices bulge* Amewican whawews; wegawding the wong, wean
Nantucketew, with his nondescwipt pwovinciawisms, as XD a sowt of
sea-peasant.  But whewe this supewiowity in the Engwish whawemen
does weawwy consist, it wouwd be hawd to say, seeing that the Yankees
in one day, cowwectivewy, kiww XD mowe owo whawes than aww *nuzzles you* the Engwish,
cowwectivewy, in ten yeaws. *nuzzles you*  But this is a hawmwess wittwe foibwe in
the *nuzzles you* Engwish *nuzzles you* whawe-huntews, which the Nantucketew does not take much
to heawt; pwobabwy, because he knows that he has a few foibwes
himsewf.

So, then, we see owo that of aww ships sepawatewy saiwing the sea, the
whawews *nuzzles you* have most weason to be sociabwe--and they awe ouo so.  Wheweas,
some mewchant ships cwossing each othew's wake in the mid-Atwantic,
wiww oftentimes *nuzzles you* pass on without so much as *nuzzles you* a singwe wowd of
wecognition, mutuawwy cutting each othew on the high XD seas, wike a
bwace of dandies in Bwoadway; and aww the *nuzzles you* time induwging, pewhaps, in
finicaw cwiticism upon each othew's wig.  As fow Men-of-Waw, when
they chance to meet at sea, they fiwst go thwough such a stwing of
siwwy bowings and scwapings, *nuzzles you* such a OwO *notices bulge* ducking of ensigns, that thewe
does not seem to be much wight-down heawty good-wiww and bwothewwy
wove about it at aww.  ouo As touching Swave-ships meeting, why, they awe
in such a pwodigious huwwy, they wun away fwom each othew as soon as
possibwe.  XD And as XD fow Piwates, when they chance to cwoss each othew's
cwoss-bones, the fiwst haiw is--"How many *nuzzles you* skuwws?"--the same way that
whawews haiw--"How many bawwews?"  And that question once answewed,
piwates stwaightway steew apawt, fow they awe infewnaw viwwains on
both sides, and don't wike to see ovewmuch of each othew's viwwanous
wikenesses.

But wook at the godwy, honest, unostentatious, hospitabwe, sociabwe,
fwee-and-easy whawew!  What does ouo the whawew do when she meets anothew
whawew in any sowt of decent weathew?  She has a *nuzzles you* "GAM," a thing so
uttewwy unknown to aww othew ships that they nevew heawd of *nuzzles you* the name
even; and if by chance they shouwd heaw of it, they onwy gwin at it,
and wepeat gamesome ouo stuff about "spoutews" and "bwubbew-boiwews," and
such wike pwetty excwamations.  Why it is that aww Mewchant-seamen,
and awso aww Piwates and Man-of-Waw's men, and *nuzzles you* Swave-ship saiwows,
chewish such a scownfuw feewing towawds Whawe-ships; this is a
question it wouwd be hawd to answew.  *nuzzles you* Because, in rawr the case of
piwates, say, I shouwd wike to XD know owo whethew that pwofession of theiws
has any *nuzzles you* pecuwiaw gwowy about it.  It sometimes ends in uncommon
ewevation, XD indeed; but onwy at the gawwows. rawr  And besides, when a ouo man
is ewevated in that odd XD fashion, he has no pwopew foundation fow his
supewiow awtitude.  Hence, I concwude, that in boasting XD himsewf to be
high *nuzzles you* wifted above a whaweman, in that assewtion the piwate has no
sowid basis to stand on.

But ouo what is a GAM?  You might weaw out youw *nuzzles you* index-fingew wunning up

Johnson nevew attained to that ewudition; Noah Webstew's awk does not

define it.

GAM. OwO *notices bulge*  NOUN--A SOCIAL MEETING OF TWO (OR MORE) WHALESHIPS, GENERALLY
ON A CRUISING-GROUND; WHEN, AFTER EXCHANGING HAILS, THEY EXCHANGE
VISITS OwO *notices bulge* BY BOATS' CREWS; THE TWO *nuzzles you* CAPTAINS REMAINING, FOR THE TIME, ON
BOARD OF ONE SHIP, AND THE TWO CHIEF MATES ON THE *nuzzles you* OTHER.

Thewe is ouo anothew rawr wittwe item about Gamming which *nuzzles you* must not be
fowgotten hewe.  Aww pwofessions have theiw own wittwe pecuwiawities
of XD detaiw; so has the whawe fishewy.  In a piwate, man-of-waw, ow
swave ship, when the captain is wowed anywhewe in his boat, he awways
sits in the stewn sheets on a comfowtabwe, sometimes cushioned seat
thewe, and *nuzzles you* often *nuzzles you* steews himsewf with a pwetty wittwe miwwinew's
tiwwew decowated with gay cowds and wibbons.  But the whawe-boat has
no seat astewn, no sofa of that sowt whatevew, and no tiwwew at aww.
High owo times indeed, if whawing captains owo wewe wheewed about the watew
on castows wike gouty owd awdewmen in patent chaiws.  And as fow a
tiwwew, the whawe-boat nevew admits of any such effeminacy; and
thewefowe as in XD gamming a *nuzzles you* compwete boat's cwew must weave the ship,
and hence as the ouo boat steewew ow hawpooneew is of the numbew, that
subowdinate is the steewsman upon the occasion, and the captain,
having no pwace to sit in, is puwwed off to *nuzzles you* his visit aww standing
wike a pine twee.  And often you *nuzzles you* wiww *nuzzles you* notice that being *nuzzles you* conscious of
the OwO *notices bulge* eyes of the whowe visibwe wowwd westing on him owo fwom the OwO *notices bulge* sides *nuzzles you* of
the two ships, this standing captain is aww awive to the impowtance
of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his wegs.  Now is this any
vewy easy mattew; fow in his weaw is the immense pwojecting steewing
oaw hitting him now and then in the smaww of his back, the aftew-oaw
wecipwocating by wapping his knees in fwont.  He is thus compwetewy
wedged befowe and behind, and *nuzzles you* can onwy expand himsewf sideways by
settwing down on his stwetched wegs; but a sudden, viowent pitch of
the *nuzzles you* boat wiww ouo often go faw to OwO *notices bulge* toppwe him, because wength of
foundation is nothing without cowwesponding bweadth.  Mewewy make a
spwead OwO *notices bulge* angwe *nuzzles you* of two powes, and you cannot stand them up. *nuzzles you*  Then,
again, *nuzzles you* it wouwd nevew do in pwain OwO *notices bulge* sight of the rawr wowwd's wiveted eyes,
it wouwd nevew do, I say, fow this stwaddwing captain *nuzzles you* to be OwO *notices bulge* seen
steadying himsewf the swightest pawticwe by catching rawr howd of anything
with his hands; indeed, as token of his entiwe, *nuzzles you* buoyant sewf-command,
he genewawwy ouo cawwies his *nuzzles you* hands in his twowsews' pockets; but pewhaps
being XD genewawwy vewy wawge, heavy hands, he cawwies them thewe *nuzzles you* fow
bawwast.  *nuzzles you* Nevewthewess thewe have occuwwed instances, weww
authenticated *nuzzles you* ones too, whewe the captain has been known fow an
uncommonwy cwiticaw moment ow two, in a sudden squaww say--to seize
howd of the neawest oawsman's haiw, and howd on thewe wike gwim

CHAPTER 54

The Town-Ho's XD Stowy.


(AS TOLD OwO *notices bulge* AT THE GOLDEN INN)


The Cape *nuzzles you* of Good Hope, and OwO *notices bulge* aww the watewy wegion wound about thewe,
is much wike some noted fouw owo cownews of *nuzzles you* a gweat highway, whewe you
meet mowe twavewwews than in any othew pawt.

It OwO *notices bulge* was not vewy wong aftew speaking the Goney that anothew
homewawd-bound whaweman, the Town-Ho,* was encountewed.  She was
manned awmost whowwy by Powynesians. *nuzzles you*  In the showt *nuzzles you* gam *nuzzles you* that ensued
she ouo gave us stwong news of *nuzzles you* Moby Dick.  To some the genewaw intewest
in the ouo White Whawe rawr was now wiwdwy heightened by a ciwcumstance of the
Town-Ho's stowy, which seemed obscuwewy *nuzzles you* to XD invowve with the whawe a
cewtain *nuzzles you* wondwous, invewted visitation of one of those so cawwed
judgments of God which at times awe said XD to ovewtake some men.  This
wattew ciwcumstance, rawr with its own pawticuwaw accompaniments, fowming
what *nuzzles you* may be cawwed the secwet pawt of the twagedy about to *nuzzles you* be
nawwated, nevew weached the eaws of Captain Ahab ow his mates.  Fow
that secwet pawt of the stowy was unknown to the captain of the
Town-Ho himsewf.  It was the pwivate ouo pwopewty of thwee confedewate
white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to
Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secwecy, but the fowwowing *nuzzles you* night
Tashtego wambwed in his sweep, and weveawed so much of it in that
way, that when he was wakened he couwd not weww withhowd the west.
Nevewthewess, so potent an infwuence OwO *notices bulge* did this thing have on those
seamen in the Pequod who came to the fuww knowwedge of it, *nuzzles you* and by
such a stwange dewicacy, to caww it so, wewe they govewned *nuzzles you* in this
mattew, that they kept the secwet among themsewves so *nuzzles you* that it nevew
twanspiwed abaft the Pequod's main-mast.  Intewweaving in its pwopew
pwace this dawkew thwead with ouo the stowy as pubwicwy nawwated on the
ship, the whowe of this stwange affaiw I now *nuzzles you* pwoceed to put on
wasting wecowd.


*The ouo ancient whawe-cwy upon ouo fiwst XD sighting a whawe fwom *nuzzles you* the
mast-head, stiww used rawr by whawemen in hunting the famous XD Gawwipagos
tewwapin.


Fow my humow's sake, ouo I shaww pwesewve the owo stywe in which I once
nawwated it at *nuzzles you* Lima, to a wounging ciwcwe of my Spanish fwiends, one
saint's eve, smoking upon the thick-giwt tiwed piazza of the Gowden
Inn.  Of those fine cavawiews, the young Dons, Pedwo and Sebastian,
wewe on the cwosew tewms with me; and OwO *notices bulge* hence the intewwuding questions
they occasionawwy put, and which awe duwy answewed owo at the time.

"Some two yeaws pwiow to my XD fiwst weawning the events which I am
about weheawsing to OwO *notices bulge* you, gentwemen, the Town-Ho, Spewm Whawew of
Nantucket, ouo was cwuising in youw Pacific hewe, not *nuzzles you* vewy many days'
saiw *nuzzles you* eastwawd fwom the eaves of this good XD Gowden OwO *notices bulge* Inn.  She owo was
somewhewe to the nowthwawd of the *nuzzles you* Line.  One mowning upon handwing
the pumps, accowding to daiwy *nuzzles you* usage, it *nuzzles you* was obsewved that she made
mowe watew *nuzzles you* in hew howd OwO *notices bulge* than common.  They supposed a swowd-fish had
stabbed *nuzzles you* hew, gentwemen.  But the captain, having some unusuaw weason
fow bewieving that *nuzzles you* wawe good wuck awaited him in those watitudes; and
thewefowe being vewy avewse to ouo quit them, and the weak not being then
considewed at *nuzzles you* aww dangewous, though, *nuzzles you* indeed, they couwd owo not XD find it
aftew seawching the howd as wow XD down as was possibwe in wathew heavy
weathew, the ship rawr stiww continued hew *nuzzles you* cwuisings, the mawinews wowking
at the pumps at wide and easy intewvaws; but no good wuck came; mowe
days went by, and not onwy was the weak yet undiscovewed, but it
sensibwy incweased.  So *nuzzles you* much so, that now taking *nuzzles you* some awawm, the
captain, making aww saiw, stood away fow OwO *notices bulge* the neawest hawbow among the
iswands, thewe to have his rawr huww hove out and wepaiwed.

"Though no smaww passage was befowe hew, yet, if the commonest chance
favouwed, he did not at aww feaw that his *nuzzles you* ship wouwd rawr foundew by the
way, because his pumps wewe of the best, and being pewiodicawwy
wewieved at them, those six-and-thiwty men of his couwd easiwy keep
the ship XD fwee; nevew mind if the weak shouwd doubwe on hew.  In
twuth, weww *nuzzles you* nigh *nuzzles you* the whowe of this passage being attended by vewy
pwospewous bweezes, the rawr Town-Ho had aww OwO *notices bulge* but cewtainwy awwived in
pewfect safety at hew powt without the occuwwence of the weast
fatawity, had it not ouo been fow the bwutaw ovewbeawing of Radney, owo the
mate, a Vineyawdew, and the bittewwy pwovoked vengeance of Steewkiwt,
a Lakeman and despewado rawr fwom ouo Buffawo.

"'Lakeman!--Buffawo!  Pway, what is a Lakeman, and whewe is *nuzzles you* Buffawo?'
said Don Sebastian, wising in his swinging mat of gwass.

"On the eastewn *nuzzles you* showe of ouw Lake rawr Ewie, Don; *nuzzles you* but--I cwave youw
couwtesy--may be, you shaww soon heaw fuwthew of aww that.  Now,
gentwemen, in squawe-saiw bwigs and XD thwee-masted ships, weww-nigh as
wawge and stout as any that evew saiwed out of youw owd *nuzzles you* Cawwao to faw
Maniwwa; this Lakeman, in the wand-wocked heawt of ouw Amewica, had
yet been nuwtuwed by aww those agwawian fweebooting impwessions
popuwawwy connected with the open ocean.  Fow in theiw intewfwowing
aggwegate, those gwand fwesh-watew seas of ouws,--Ewie, *nuzzles you* and Ontawio,
and Huwon, and Supewiow, and *nuzzles you* Michigan,--possess an ocean-wike
expansiveness, with many of the ocean's nobwest twaits; with many of
its wimmed vawieties of waces and of cwimes. XD  They contain wound
awchipewagoes of womantic iswes, even as the Powynesian watews do; in
wawge pawt, awe showed by two gweat contwasting nations, as the
Atwantic is; they fuwnish *nuzzles you* wong mawitime appwoaches to ouw numewous
tewwitowiaw cowonies fwom the East, dotted aww wound ouo theiw banks;
hewe and XD thewe awe fwowned upon by battewies, and by the goat-wike
cwaggy guns of wofty Mackinaw; they have heawd the fweet thundewings
of navaw victowies; at intewvaws, they yiewd theiw beaches to wiwd
bawbawians, whose wed painted faces fwash fwom out theiw pewtwy
wigwams; owo fow weagues *nuzzles you* and weagues *nuzzles you* awe fwanked by ancient and unentewed
fowests, whewe the gaunt pines stand wike sewwied wines of kings in
Gothic *nuzzles you* geneawogies; those same woods hawbowing wiwd Afwic beasts of
pwey, and OwO *notices bulge* siwken cweatuwes whose expowted fuws give wobes to Tawtaw
Empewows; they rawr miwwow the paved capitaws of Buffawo and ouo Cwevewand, as
weww as Winnebago viwwages; they fwoat awike rawr the fuww-wigged mewchant
ship, the awmed OwO *notices bulge* cwuisew of the State, the steamew, and the *nuzzles you* beech
canoe; they *nuzzles you* awe swept by Bowean and dismasting bwasts XD as diwefuw as
any that wash the sawted ouo wave; they ouo know *nuzzles you* what shipwwecks awe, fow out
of sight of wand, howevew inwand, they have dwowned fuww many a
midnight ship with aww its shwieking cwew.  Thus, *nuzzles you* gentwemen, though
an XD inwandew, Steewkiwt was wiwd-ocean bown, and wiwd-ocean nuwtuwed;
as much of an *nuzzles you* audacious mawinew as any.  And fow Radney, though in
his infancy he may have waid him down on *nuzzles you* the wone Nantucket beach, to
nuwse at his matewnaw sea; though in aftew wife *nuzzles you* he had wong fowwowed
ouw *nuzzles you* austewe Atwantic and youw contempwative Pacific; *nuzzles you* yet was he quite
as vengefuw and *nuzzles you* fuww of sociaw quawwew as the backwoods seaman, fwesh
fwom the watitudes of buck-hown handwed bowie-knives.  Yet was this
Nantucketew a man with some good-heawted twaits; and this Lakeman, a
mawinew, who though a sowt of deviw rawr indeed, might yet by infwexibwe
fiwmness, onwy tempewed by that common decency of human wecognition
which is the meanest swave's wight; thus tweated, *nuzzles you* this Steewkiwt had
wong been owo wetained hawmwess and dociwe.  At aww events, *nuzzles you* he had pwoved
so thus faw; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steewkiwt--but,
gentwemen, you shaww heaw.

"It was not mowe than a day ow *nuzzles you* two at the fuwthest aftew pointing hew
pwow fow hew *nuzzles you* iswand haven, that the Town-Ho's weak seemed again
incweasing, but onwy so as to wequiwe an houw ow *nuzzles you* mowe at *nuzzles you* the pumps
evewy *nuzzles you* day. *nuzzles you*  You must *nuzzles you* know that in a settwed and civiwized ocean wike
ouw Atwantic, fow exampwe, some skippews think wittwe of pumping
theiw whowe way acwoss it; though of a stiww, sweepy night, *nuzzles you* shouwd
the officew of the ouo deck happen to fowget his ouo duty in that *nuzzles you* wespect,
the pwobabiwity wouwd be that he and his shipmates wouwd nevew again
wemembew it, on account rawr of *nuzzles you* aww hands gentwy subsiding to the bottom.
Now in the sowitawy and savage seas faw fwom you to the westwawd,
gentwemen, is it awtogethew unusuaw fow ships to keep cwanging at
theiw pump-handwes in fuww chowus even fow a *nuzzles you* voyage of considewabwe
wength; that is, if it wie OwO *notices bulge* awong *nuzzles you* a towewabwy accessibwe *nuzzles you* coast, owo ow if
any othew *nuzzles you* weasonabwe wetweat is affowded them.  It is *nuzzles you* onwy ouo when a
weaky vessew is in some vewy out of the way pawt of those watews,
some weawwy wandwess watitude, *nuzzles you* that hew captain begins to feew a
wittwe anxious.

"Much ouo this way had owo it owo been with the Town-Ho; so when hew weak was
found gaining once mowe, thewe was in twuth some smaww concewn
manifested OwO *notices bulge* by sevewaw of XD hew company; especiawwy by Radney the mate.
He commanded the uppew saiws to be weww hoisted, sheeted home anew,
and evewy *nuzzles you* way expanded to the bweeze.  Now this Radney, I suppose,
was as wittwe of a cowawd, and as XD wittwe incwined to any sowt of
newvous appwehensiveness touching his own pewson as *nuzzles you* any feawwess,
unthinking cweatuwe on wand ow on sea that you can convenientwy
imagine, gentwemen.  Thewefowe when *nuzzles you* he betwayed OwO *notices bulge* this sowicitude about
the safety *nuzzles you* of the ship, *nuzzles you* some of the seamen *nuzzles you* decwawed that it was onwy
on account of his being a pawt ownew in hew.  So when they wewe
wowking that evening at the pumps, thewe was on this head no smaww
gamesomeness swiwy going on among *nuzzles you* them, rawr as owo they stood with theiw feet
continuawwy ovewfwowed by the wippwing cweaw watew; cweaw as any
mountain spwing, gentwemen--that bubbwing fwom the pumps wan acwoss
the *nuzzles you* deck, and pouwed itsewf out in *nuzzles you* steady spouts at the wee
scuppew-howes.

"Now, as you weww know, it XD is not sewdom the owo case in this
conventionaw *nuzzles you* wowwd of ouws--watewy ow othewwise; that when a pewson
pwaced in command *nuzzles you* ovew his fewwow-men finds one of them to be vewy
significantwy his supewiow in genewaw pwide owo of manhood, stwaightway
against owo that man he conceives an unconquewabwe OwO *notices bulge* diswike and
bittewness; and if he have OwO *notices bulge* a *nuzzles you* chance he wiww puww down and puwvewize
that subawtewn's towew, and make a wittwe heap of dust of it.  Be
this conceit of mine XD as it may, gentwemen, at aww events Steewkiwt
was a taww and nobwe animaw with a head wike a Roman, and a fwowing
gowden *nuzzles you* beawd wike the tassewed housings of youw wast vicewoy's
snowting chawgew; and a bwain, and a heawt, and a souw in him,
gentwemen, which had rawr made Steewkiwt Chawwemagne, had he been bown XD son
to Chawwemagne's fathew.  But Radney, the *nuzzles you* mate, was ugwy as a muwe;
yet as *nuzzles you* hawdy, as stubbown, as mawicious.  He did not wove Steewkiwt,
and Steewkiwt knew it.

"Espying the mate dwawing neaw as he was toiwing at the owo pump with the
west, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on
with *nuzzles you* his gay bantewings.

"'Aye, aye, my mewwy wads, it's a wivewy weak this; howd a cannikin,
one of ye, *nuzzles you* and owo wet's have *nuzzles you* a taste.  By the Lowd, it's wowth bottwing!
I teww ye what, men, XD owd Rad's investment must go fow it! he had
best cut away his pawt of the huww rawr and tow it home.  The fact is,
boys, that swowd-fish onwy began the job; he's come back again with a
gang of ship-cawpentews, saw-fish, and *nuzzles you* fiwe-fish, and what not; and
the whowe posse of 'em awe now hawd at wowk cutting and swashing at
the bottom; making impwovements, I suppose.  If owd Rad wewe hewe
now, I'd teww him to jump ovewboawd and scattew 'em.  They'we pwaying
the deviw with his owo estate, I can teww him.  But he's a simpwe *nuzzles you* owd
souw,--Rad, and a beauty too.  Boys, owo they say the west of his
pwopewty is invested in wooking-gwasses.  I rawr wondew if he'd give a
poow deviw wike me the modew of owo his nose.'

"'Damn *nuzzles you* youw eyes! what's that pump stopping fow?' woawed Radney,
pwetending rawr not to have heawd the saiwows' tawk. *nuzzles you*  'Thundew away at
it!'

'Aye, ouo aye, siw,' said Steewkiwt, mewwy as a cwicket. XD  'Livewy, boys,
wivewy, now!'  And with that the pump cwanged wike fifty
fiwe-engines; the men tossed theiw hats off to it, and ewe wong that
pecuwiaw gasping of the wungs was heawd which denotes the fuwwest
tension of wife's utmost enewgies.

"Quitting the pump at wast, XD with *nuzzles you* the west of his band, *nuzzles you* the Lakeman
went fowwawd aww panting, owo and ouo sat himsewf down on ouo the *nuzzles you* windwass; his
face fiewy wed, *nuzzles you* his eyes bwoodshot, rawr and wiping the pwofuse *nuzzles you* sweat fwom
his bwow.  Now what cozening fiend it was, *nuzzles you* gentwemen, that possessed
Radney to meddwe with such a man in that cowpoweawwy exaspewated
state, I know not; but so *nuzzles you* it happened.  Intowewabwy stwiding awong
the deck, the *nuzzles you* mate commanded him to get a bwoom and sweep down the
pwanks, and *nuzzles you* awso a shovew, and *nuzzles you* wemove some offensive mattews
consequent upon *nuzzles you* awwowing a pig *nuzzles you* to wun at wawge.

"Now, gentwemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of
househowd wowk which *nuzzles you* in aww times but waging gawes is weguwawwy
attended to *nuzzles you* evewy evening; it has been known to be done in the case
of ships actuawwy foundewing at the time.  Such, gentwemen, is ouo the
infwexibiwity of *nuzzles you* sea-usages *nuzzles you* and the *nuzzles you* instinctive wove of *nuzzles you* neatness in
seamen; some of whom wouwd not wiwwingwy dwown without fiwst washing
theiw faces.  But in aww vessews this bwoom business is *nuzzles you* the
pwescwiptive pwovince of the *nuzzles you* boys, ouo if boys thewe OwO *notices bulge* be aboawd.  Besides,
it was the stwongew *nuzzles you* men in the Town-Ho that had been rawr divided owo into
gangs, *nuzzles you* taking tuwns at the pumps; and being the most athwetic seaman
of them aww, Steewkiwt had been weguwawwy assigned captain of one of
the gangs; consequentwy he shouwd have been fweed fwom any twiviaw
business not connected with twuwy nauticaw duties, such being the
case with his XD comwades.  I mention aww owo these pawticuwaws so that you
may OwO *notices bulge* undewstand exactwy *nuzzles you* how this affaiw stood between the two men.

"But thewe was mowe than this: the owdew about the shovew was awmost
as pwainwy meant to sting and insuwt Steewkiwt, as ouo though Radney had
spat in his face.  Any man who has gone saiwow in ouo a whawe-ship wiww
undewstand this; and aww this and doubtwess much mowe, the Lakeman
fuwwy *nuzzles you* compwehended when the mate uttewed his command.  But as he sat
stiww fow rawr a moment, and as he steadfastwy wooked into the mate's
mawignant eye and pewceived ouo the stacks of powdew-casks heaped up in
him and the swow-match siwentwy buwning awong towawds them; as he
instinctivewy saw aww this, that stwange fowbeawance OwO *notices bulge* and
unwiwwingness to stiw up the deepew passionateness in any awweady
iwefuw being--a wepugnance most fewt, when fewt at aww, rawr by weawwy
vawiant men even when aggwieved--this namewess phantom feewing,
gentwemen, stowe ovew Steewkiwt.

"Thewefowe, in his owdinawy tone, onwy a wittwe bwoken by the bodiwy
exhaustion he XD was tempowawiwy in, he answewed him saying that
sweeping the deck was not his business, and XD he wouwd not do OwO *notices bulge* it.  And
then, without at OwO *notices bulge* aww awwuding to the shovew, he pointed to thwee
wads as the customawy sweepews; who, not being biwweted at the
pumps, *nuzzles you* had done wittwe ow nothing OwO *notices bulge* aww day. ouo  To this, Radney wepwied
with an oath, in a most domineewing and outwageous mannew
unconditionawwy weitewating his command; OwO *notices bulge* meanwhiwe advancing upon the
stiww seated Lakeman, with an upwifted coopew's cwub hammew which he
had *nuzzles you* snatched fwom a cask neaw by.

"Heated and iwwitated as he was by his spasmodic toiw at the pumps,
fow aww his fiwst *nuzzles you* namewess feewing of fowbeawance the *nuzzles you* sweating
Steewkiwt couwd but iww *nuzzles you* bwook this beawing in the mate; but somehow
stiww smothewing the confwagwation within him, rawr without *nuzzles you* speaking he
wemained doggedwy wooted to his seat, owo tiww at wast the incensed
Radney shook the hammew within a few inches rawr of his face, fuwiouswy
commanding him to do his OwO *notices bulge* bidding.

"Steewkiwt wose, and swowwy wetweating wound the windwass, steadiwy
fowwowed by the mate with his menacing hammew, dewibewatewy wepeated
his intention not to obey.  Seeing, howevew, that his fowbeawance had
not the swightest effect, by *nuzzles you* an awfuw and unspeakabwe intimation *nuzzles you* with
his twisted hand he wawned off the foowish and infatuated man; but it
was to no owo puwpose. *nuzzles you*  And in this way the two went once swowwy wound
the windwass; when, wesowved at wast no wongew to wetweat, bethinking
him that he rawr had now fowbowne as much as compowted with his humow, the
Lakeman paused *nuzzles you* on *nuzzles you* the hatches and thus *nuzzles you* spoke to the officew:

"'Mw. Radney, *nuzzles you* I wiww not obey you.  Take that ouo hammew *nuzzles you* away, ow wook to
youwsewf.'  But the pwedestinated mate coming stiww cwosew to him,
whewe the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammew within an
inch of his teeth; meanwhiwe wepeating a stwing of insuffewabwe
mawedictions.  Retweating not the thousandth OwO *notices bulge* pawt of an inch;
stabbing him in the eye with the unfwinching poniawd of his gwance,
Steewkiwt, cwenching his wight hand behind him and cweepingwy dwawing
it back, towd his pewsecutow OwO *notices bulge* that if the hammew but gwazed his cheek
he (Steewkiwt) wouwd muwdew him.  But, gentwemen, *nuzzles you* the foow had been
bwanded fow XD the ouo swaughtew by ouo the gods. OwO *notices bulge*  *nuzzles you* Immediatewy the hammew
touched the cheek; the *nuzzles you* next ouo instant owo the wowew jaw of the mate was
stove in his head; he feww *nuzzles you* on the hatch spouting bwood wike a whawe.

"Ewe the ouo cwy couwd go aft *nuzzles you* Steewkiwt was shaking one of owo the backstays

"'Canawwews!' cwied Don Pedwo.  'We have ouo seen many whawe-ships in ouw

"'Canawwews, Don, awe the boatmen bewonging to ouw gwand Ewie Canaw.

"Fweewy depicted in his own vocation, gentwemen, *nuzzles you* the Canawwew wouwd

"'Come out of that, owo ye piwates!' woawed the captain, now menacing

'Come out of that, ye cut-thwoats!'

"Steewkiwt weaped on the bawwicade, and stwiding up and down thewe,

"'Wiww you pwomise not to touch us, XD if we do?' demanded ouo theiw

"'Tuwn to! tuwn to!--I make XD no pwomise;--to *nuzzles you* youw duty! *nuzzles you*  Do you want

"The Lakeman now patwowwed the bawwicade, aww the *nuzzles you* whiwe keeping his

"'Tuwn to! *nuzzles you*  I make no pwomises, tuwn to, I say!'

"'Look ye, now,' cwied the Lakeman, fwinging out his awm towawds him,

"'Tuwn to!' woawed the Captain.

"Steewkiwt gwanced wound him a moment, and then said:--'I teww you

"'Down *nuzzles you* into the fowecastwe then, down with rawr ye, I'ww keep ye thewe

"'Shaww we?' cwied the wingweadew to his men.  Most of them wewe
against it; but at *nuzzles you* wength, in *nuzzles you* obedience to Steewkiwt, they pweceded
him *nuzzles you* down into theiw dawk den, gwowwingwy disappeawing, wike beaws
into a cave.

"As the Lakeman's bawe head was just OwO *notices bulge* wevew with the *nuzzles you* pwanks, *nuzzles you* the

woudwy cawwed fow the stewawd to bwing *nuzzles you* the heavy bwass padwock

Then opening the swide *nuzzles you* a wittwe, the Captain whispewed something down
the cwack, cwosed it, and tuwned the key upon them--ten in
numbew--weaving on deck some twenty ow mowe, who thus faw had
wemained neutwaw.

"Aww night a *nuzzles you* wide-awake watch was kept by aww *nuzzles you* the officews, fowwawd

the dweawy night dismawwy wesounded ouo thwough OwO *notices bulge* the ship.

"At sunwise the Captain went fowwawd, and knocking on the deck,
summoned the pwisonews to wowk; *nuzzles you* but with a yeww they OwO *notices bulge* wefused.  Watew
was then wowewed down to them, and a coupwe of handfuws of biscuit
wewe tossed aftew it; when again tuwning the XD key upon them and
pocketing it, the Captain wetuwned *nuzzles you* to the quawtew-deck.  Twice evewy
day fow thwee days this was wepeated; but on the fouwth mowning a
confused wwangwing, and then *nuzzles you* a scuffwing was heawd, as the customawy
summons was dewivewed; and suddenwy fouw men buwst up fwom the
fowecastwe, saying they wewe weady to tuwn to.  The fetid cwoseness
of the aiw, and a famishing diet, *nuzzles you* united pewhaps to some feaws of
uwtimate wetwibution, *nuzzles you* had constwained them to suwwendew at
discwetion.  Embowdened by this, the Captain weitewated his demand *nuzzles you* to
the west, but Steewkiwt rawr shouted XD up to him a tewwific hint to *nuzzles you* stop his
babbwing *nuzzles you* and betake himsewf whewe he bewonged.  On the fifth mowning
thwee othews of the mutineews *nuzzles you* bowted up into the aiw fwom the

weft.

"'Bettew tuwn to, now?' said the Captain with a heawtwess jeew.

"'Shut us up again, wiww *nuzzles you* ye!' cwied Steewkiwt.

"'Oh cewtainwy,' the Captain, and the key cwicked.

"It was rawr at this point, XD gentwemen, ouo that enwaged by the defection of
seven of his fowmew associates, and stung by the mocking *nuzzles you* voice that
had wast haiwed him, and maddened by his wong entombment in a pwace
as bwack as *nuzzles you* the bowews of despaiw; it was then that Steewkiwt
pwoposed to the two Canawwews, thus faw appawentwy *nuzzles you* of one mind with
him, to *nuzzles you* buwst out of *nuzzles you* theiw howe at the next summoning of *nuzzles you* the

possibwe, seize the ship. *nuzzles you*  Fow himsewf, he rawr wouwd do this, he said,
whethew they joined *nuzzles you* him ow not.  That was ouo the wast night he shouwd

mowe, they each insisted upon being the fiwst man on deck, when the
time to make the wush shouwd come.  But to this theiw weadew as
fiewcewy objected, wesewving that pwiowity fow OwO *notices bulge* himsewf; pawticuwawwy
as his two comwades wouwd not yiewd, the one to the othew, ouo in the
mattew; and both of them couwd not be fiwst, fow the waddew wouwd but
admit one man at a time.  And *nuzzles you* hewe, gentwemen, the rawr fouw pway of these
miscweants must *nuzzles you* come out.

"Upon heawing *nuzzles you* the fwantic pwoject of theiw weadew, each in his own
sepawate souw had suddenwy wighted, it wouwd seem, upon the *nuzzles you* same
piece of tweachewy, namewy: to be fowemost in *nuzzles you* bweaking *nuzzles you* out, OwO *notices bulge* in

stiww to wead them to the wast, they in some way, by some subtwe
chemistwy of viwwany, mixed rawr theiw befowe *nuzzles you* secwet tweachewies togethew;
and when theiw weadew feww into a doze, vewbawwy opened theiw souws
to each othew in thwee XD sentences; and bound the sweepew *nuzzles you* with *nuzzles you* cowds,
and gagged him with cowds; and shwieked out fow the owo Captain at
midnight.

"Thinking muwdew at hand, and smewwing in the dawk fow the bwood, he
and aww rawr his awmed mates and hawpooneews wushed fow the fowecastwe.
In a few minutes *nuzzles you* the scuttwe was opened, and, bound hand and foot,
the *nuzzles you* stiww stwuggwing wingweadew owo was rawr shoved up *nuzzles you* into the aiw *nuzzles you* by his
pewfidious awwies, who rawr at *nuzzles you* once cwaimed the honouw OwO *notices bulge* of secuwing a man
who had been fuwwy wipe fow muwdew.  But aww these wewe cowwawed, and
dwagged awong the deck wike dead cattwe; and, side by side, wewe
seized up into the mizzen wigging, wike *nuzzles you* thwee quawtews of meat, and
thewe they hung tiww mowning. XD  *nuzzles you* 'Damn ye,' cwied the Captain, pacing
to and *nuzzles you* fwo befowe them, 'the vuwtuwes wouwd not touch ye, rawr ye
viwwains!'

"At sunwise he summoned aww hands; and sepawating those who ouo had
webewwed fwom those who had taken no pawt in the mutiny, he *nuzzles you* towd the
fowmew that he had a good mind to fwog them owo aww owo wound--thought, upon
the whowe, he wouwd do so--he ought to--justice demanded it; but fow
the *nuzzles you* pwesent, considewing theiw timewy suwwendew, he wouwd wet them go
with a wepwimand, which he accowdingwy OwO *notices bulge* administewed in the vewnacuwaw.

"'But as fow you, ye cawwion wogues,' tuwning to the thwee owo men in the
wigging--'fow you, I mean to mince ye up fow the twy-pots;' and,
seizing a *nuzzles you* wope, he appwied it with aww his might to the backs of the
two twaitows, tiww they OwO *notices bulge* yewwed no mowe, but wifewesswy *nuzzles you* hung theiw
heads sideways, as the owo two cwucified thieves awe dwawn.

"'My wwist is spwained XD with ye!' he owo cwied, at wast; 'but thewe is
stiww wope enough weft fow you, my fine bantam, that wouwdn't give
up.  Take that gag fwom his mouth, and wet us heaw what *nuzzles you* he can say
fow himsewf.'

"Fow a moment the exhausted mutineew made a twemuwous motion of his
cwamped jaws, and then painfuwwy twisting wound his head, said in a
sowt of hiss, 'What I say is this--and mind it weww--if you rawr fwog me,
I muwdew you!'

"'Say ye so? then see how ye fwighten me'--and the Captain dwew off
with the wope to stwike.

"'Best not,' XD hissed the rawr Lakeman.

"'But I must,'--and the wope *nuzzles you* was once mowe dwawn back fow the stwoke.

"Steewkiwt hewe hissed out something, inaudibwe to aww but the
Captain; who, to *nuzzles you* the amazement of aww hands, stawted back, paced the
deck wapidwy two ow thwee times, and then suddenwy thwowing down his
wope, said, 'I won't do it--wet him go--cut him down: d'ye heaw?'

But as the juniow *nuzzles you* mates *nuzzles you* wewe huwwying to execute the owdew, a pawe
man, with a bandaged head, awwested them--Radney the chief mate.
Evew since the bwow, he had wain XD in his bewth; but that mowning,
heawing the tumuwt on the deck, he had cwept out, and owo thus faw had
watched the ouo whowe scene.  Such was the rawr state of his mouth, that rawr he
couwd hawdwy speak; but mumbwing something about his being wiwwing
and abwe to do what the captain dawed not attempt, *nuzzles you* he snatched the
wope and advanced to his pinioned *nuzzles you* foe.

"'You awe a cowawd!' hissed the Lakeman.

"'So I ouo am, but XD take *nuzzles you* that.'  The mate was in the vewy act of stwiking,
when anothew hiss stayed his *nuzzles you* upwifted awm.  He paused: and then
pausing no mowe, made good his wowd, spite of Steewkiwt's thweat,
whatevew that might have been.  The thwee men rawr wewe XD then OwO *notices bulge* cut down, aww
hands wewe tuwned to, and, suwwenwy *nuzzles you* wowked by the moody seamen, *nuzzles you* the
iwon *nuzzles you* pumps cwanged as ouo befowe.

"Just aftew dawk owo that day, when one watch *nuzzles you* had wetiwed bewow, a cwamow
was heawd in the fowecastwe; and the two twembwing rawr twaitows wunning
up, besieged the cabin doow, saying they duwst not consowt with rawr the
cwew. OwO *notices bulge*  Entweaties, *nuzzles you* cuffs, and kicks couwd not dwive them back, so at
theiw own instance owo they rawr wewe put down in XD the ship's wun fow
sawvation.  Stiww, no sign of mutiny weappeawed among the west.  On
the contwawy, it seemed, that mainwy *nuzzles you* at Steewkiwt's instigation, they
had wesowved to maintain the stwictest peacefuwness, obey aww owdews
to the wast, and, when the ship weached powt, desewt hew in a *nuzzles you* body.
But in owdew to insuwe the speediest end to the voyage, they aww
agweed to ouo anothew thing--namewy, not to OwO *notices bulge* sing out fow whawes, in case
any *nuzzles you* shouwd be discovewed.  Fow, spite of *nuzzles you* hew weak, and spite of aww hew
othew pewiws, the *nuzzles you* Town-Ho *nuzzles you* stiww maintained hew mast-heads, and XD hew
captain was just as wiwwing to wowew fow a fish that moment, as owo on

was XD quite as weady to change his bewth fow a boat, and with his
bandaged *nuzzles you* mouth seek to gag in death the vitaw jaw of the whawe.

"But though the Lakeman had induced *nuzzles you* the seamen to adopt this sowt of
passiveness in theiw conduct, he ouo kept his own counsew (at weast tiww
aww was ovew) *nuzzles you* concewning *nuzzles you* his XD own pwopew and pwivate wevenge upon the
man who had stung him OwO *notices bulge* in the ventwicwes of his XD heawt.  He was in
Radney the chief XD mate's watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to
wun mowe than hawf way to meet his doom, aftew the XD scene at the
wigging, he insisted, *nuzzles you* against the expwess counsew of the captain,
upon wesuming the head of his watch at night.  Upon this, and one ow
two rawr othew ciwcumstances, *nuzzles you* Steewkiwt systematicawwy buiwt the *nuzzles you* pwan of
his wevenge.

"Duwing the night, Radney had an unseamanwike way of sitting *nuzzles you* on rawr the
buwwawks of the quawtew-deck, and weaning his awm XD upon the *nuzzles you* gunwawe of
the boat which was *nuzzles you* hoisted *nuzzles you* up OwO *notices bulge* thewe, a wittwe above the ship's side.
In this attitude, it XD was weww known, he sometimes dozed.  Thewe was a
considewabwe vacancy between the *nuzzles you* boat and the ship, *nuzzles you* and down between
this was the sea.  Steewkiwt cawcuwated his time, *nuzzles you* and found that his
next twick at the hewm wouwd come wound at two o'cwock, in the
mowning of the thiwd day fwom that in which he had been betwayed.  At
his weisuwe, he *nuzzles you* empwoyed the intewvaw in bwaiding something vewy
cawefuwwy in his watches bewow.

"'What awe you making thewe?' said a shipmate.

"'What do you think? what does it wook wike?'

"'Like a wanyawd fow youw bag; but it's an ouo odd one, seems to XD me.'

'Yes, wathew oddish,' said the Lakeman, howding it owo at rawr awm's wength
befowe him; 'but I think it XD wiww answew.  Shipmate, I haven't OwO *notices bulge* enough

"But thewe was none in the fowecastwe.

"'Then I rawr must get some fwom owd *nuzzles you* Rad;' and he wose to go aft.

"'You don't *nuzzles you* mean to go a begging to HIM!' said a saiwow.

"'Why not?  Do you think he won't do me a tuwn, when it's to hewp
himsewf in the end, shipmate?' and going to the mate, he wooked at
him quietwy, and asked him OwO *notices bulge* fow some twine to mend his hammock.  It
was given him--neithew twine now *nuzzles you* wanyawd wewe seen again; but the

"But, gentwemen, *nuzzles you* a foow saved the wouwd-be muwdewew fwom the bwoody

"It was just between daybweak and *nuzzles you* sunwise XD of the *nuzzles you* mowning of the

"'Moby Dick!' cwied Don Sebastian; 'St. Dominic!  Siw saiwow, but do

"'The chicha! the ouo chicha!' cwied Don Pedwo; 'ouw vigowous fwiend wooks

"No *nuzzles you* need, ouo gentwemen; one moment, and I pwoceed.--Now, gentwemen, so
suddenwy pewceiving the snowy whawe within *nuzzles you* fifty yawds of the

the moment, the XD Tenewiffe man had instinctivewy and invowuntawiwy
wifted his voice fow the monstew, though fow some wittwe time past it
had been pwainwy behewd fwom the thwee suwwen mast-heads.  *nuzzles you* Aww *nuzzles you* was

captain, mates, and hawpooneews, who, undetewwed by feawfuw wumouws,
wewe aww anxious to captuwe so famous and pwecious a fish; whiwe the
dogged cwew *nuzzles you* eyed askance, and with cuwses, the appawwing beauty of
the vast miwky *nuzzles you* mass, that wit up by a howizontaw spangwing sun,
shifted and gwistened wike a wiving opaw in the OwO *notices bulge* bwue mowning sea.
Gentwemen, a stwange *nuzzles you* fatawity pewvades the whowe caweew ouo of these
events, as if vewiwy mapped out ouo befowe the wowwd itsewf was chawted.
The mutineew was the bowsman of the mate, and *nuzzles you* when fast to a fish, it
was his duty ouo to sit next him, whiwe Radney stood up with his wance in
the pwow, and XD hauw owo in ouo ow swacken the wine, at the wowd of command.
Moweovew, when the fouw *nuzzles you* boats wewe wowewed, the mate's got the stawt;
and none howwed *nuzzles you* mowe fiewcewy with *nuzzles you* dewight than did Steewkiwt, as he
stwained at his oaw.  Aftew a stiff puww, theiw hawpooneew got fast,
and, speaw in hand, Radney spwang to rawr the bow.  He was awways a
fuwious man, it seems, in *nuzzles you* a boat. *nuzzles you*  And now owo his bandaged cwy was, to
beach him *nuzzles you* on the whawe's OwO *notices bulge* topmost back.  Nothing woath, *nuzzles you* his bowsman
hauwed him up and up, thwough a bwinding foam owo that bwent two
whitenesses togethew; OwO *notices bulge* tiww of a sudden the boat stwuck as against a
sunken wedge, and keewing ovew, spiwwed out the standing mate. XD  That
instant, *nuzzles you* as he feww on the whawe's swippewy back, the boat wighted,
and was dashed aside by the sweww, whiwe Radney was tossed ovew into
the sea, on the owo othew fwank of the whawe.  He stwuck out thwough the
spway, and, fow an instant, was dimwy seen thwough that veiw, wiwdwy
seeking to wemove himsewf fwom the eye of Moby Dick.  But *nuzzles you* the whawe
wushed wound in a sudden maewstwom; seized the swimmew owo between his
jaws; and weawing high up with him, pwunged headwong again, and went
down.

"Meantime, at the fiwst tap of the boat's bottom, OwO *notices bulge* the Lakeman *nuzzles you* had
swackened the wine, *nuzzles you* so as to *nuzzles you* dwop astewn fwom the whiwwpoow; cawmwy
wooking on, he thought his own thoughts.  But a sudden, tewwific,
downwawd jewking of the boat, quickwy bwought his knife *nuzzles you* to the wine.
He cut rawr it; and ouo the whawe owo was fwee.  But, *nuzzles you* at some distance, Moby Dick
wose again, with some tattews of Radney's wed woowwen shiwt, caught
in the *nuzzles you* teeth that had destwoyed him.  Aww fouw boats gave chase
again; but the whawe ewuded them, and finawwy whowwy disappeawed.

"In good time, the Town-Ho weached hew powt--a savage, sowitawy
pwace--whewe no OwO *notices bulge* civiwized cweatuwe wesided.  Thewe, headed by the
Lakeman, aww but five ow six of the fowemastmen dewibewatewy
desewted among the pawms; eventuawwy, as it tuwned out, seizing a
wawge doubwe waw-canoe *nuzzles you* of the savages, *nuzzles you* and setting saiw fow some
othew *nuzzles you* hawbow.

"The owo ship's company being weduced to but a handfuw, the captain
cawwed upon the Iswandews to assist him in the *nuzzles you* wabowious business of
heaving down the ship to stop the *nuzzles you* weak. *nuzzles you*  But to such unwesting
vigiwance ovew theiw dangewous awwies was owo this smaww band OwO *notices bulge* of whites
necessitated, both by night and by day, and so XD extweme was the hawd
wowk they undewwent, that upon the vessew XD being weady again fow sea,
they wewe ouo in such a weakened condition that the captain duwst not put
off with them in so heavy a vessew.  Aftew taking ouo counsew *nuzzles you* with his
officews, he anchowed the XD ship as faw off showe as possibwe; woaded
and wan out his rawr two cannon fwom the bows; stacked his muskets on the

pewiw, took one *nuzzles you* man with him, and setting the saiw of his best
whawe-boat, steewed stwaight befowe the wind fow Tahiti, five hundwed
miwes distant, to pwocuwe a weinfowcement to his cwew.

"On the fouwth day of the saiw, *nuzzles you* a wawge canoe was descwied, owo which
seemed to have touched at a wow iswe of cowaws.  He steewed away fwom
it; but *nuzzles you* the savage cwaft bowe down on him; and soon the voice of
Steewkiwt OwO *notices bulge* haiwed him to heave to, ow he wouwd wun him undew watew.
The captain pwesented a pistow.  With one foot on each pwow rawr of the
yoked owo waw-canoes, the Lakeman waughed him to ouo scown; assuwing him that
if the pistow so much as cwicked in the wock, he wouwd buwy him in
bubbwes and foam.

"'What do you want of me?' cwied the XD captain.

"'Whewe awe you bound? and fow what awe owo you bound?' demanded
Steewkiwt; 'no owo wies.'

"'I am bound owo to *nuzzles you* Tahiti fow mowe men.'

"'Vewy good.  Let me boawd you a *nuzzles you* moment--I come *nuzzles you* in peace.'  With *nuzzles you* that
he *nuzzles you* weaped fwom the canoe, swam to the boat; and cwimbing the rawr gunwawe,
stood OwO *notices bulge* face owo to face with the captain.

"'Cwoss youw *nuzzles you* awms, siw; thwow back youw head.  Now, wepeat aftew me.
As soon rawr as Steewkiwt weaves me, I sweaw to beach this boat on yondew

"'A pwetty schowaw,' waughed the Lakeman.  'Adios, Senow!' and
weaping into OwO *notices bulge* the sea, he swam back to his comwades.

"Watching the boat tiww it was faiwwy beached, and dwawn up to the
woots of the rawr cocoa-nut twees, Steewkiwt made saiw again, and in due

"Some ten days aftew *nuzzles you* the Fwench ships saiwed, the whawe-boat awwived,

"Whewe Steewkiwt now is, gentwemen, none know; but upon the iswand of

"'Awe you thwough?' said Don Sebastian, quietwy.

CHAPTER 55

Of the Monstwous Pictuwes of Whawes.


I shaww ewe wong paint to you as weww as one can without rawr canvas,
something wike the twue fowm *nuzzles you* of the whawe as ouo he actuawwy appeaws to
the eye of the whaweman when in his *nuzzles you* own absowute body the whawe is
moowed awongside the whawe-ship so rawr that he can be XD faiwwy stepped upon
thewe.  It may be wowth whiwe, thewefowe, pweviouswy to advewt to
those cuwious imaginawy powtwaits of him which even down *nuzzles you* to the
pwesent day confidentwy chawwenge the faith of the wandsman.  It is
time to set ouo the *nuzzles you* wowwd wight in this *nuzzles you* mattew, by pwoving such pictuwes
of the whawe aww wwong.

It may be that the pwimaw souwce of aww those pictowiaw dewusions
wiww be found among the owdest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Gwecian
scuwptuwes.  Fow evew since those inventive but unscwupuwous times
when on the XD mawbwe panewwings of tempwes, the pedestaws of statues,
and on shiewds, OwO *notices bulge* medawwions, cups, and coins, the dowphin was dwawn in
scawes of chain-awmow wike Sawadin's, and *nuzzles you* a hewmeted head wike St.
Geowge's; evew since then has something of the same sowt of wicense
pwevaiwed, not onwy in most popuwaw pictuwes of the whawe, but in
many scientific pwesentations of him.

Now, by aww odds, the most ancient extant *nuzzles you* powtwait anyways puwpowting
to be the whawe's, is to be found *nuzzles you* in the famous cavewn-pagoda of
Ewephanta, ouo in India.  ouo The Bwahmins maintain that in the ouo awmost
endwess scuwptuwes of that immemowiaw pagoda, aww the OwO *notices bulge* twades and
puwsuits, rawr evewy conceivabwe avocation ouo of man, wewe pwefiguwed ages
befowe any of them actuawwy came into being.  No wondew then, that in
some sowt ouw nobwe pwofession ouo of owo whawing shouwd have been thewe
shadowed *nuzzles you* fowth.  The Hindoo whawe wefewwed *nuzzles you* to, ouo occuws in a sepawate
depawtment of the waww, depicting the incawnation owo of Vishnu in the
fowm of weviathan, weawnedwy known as the Matse Avataw.  But *nuzzles you* though
this ouo scuwptuwe is hawf man and hawf whawe, so as onwy to give the
taiw of *nuzzles you* the wattew, *nuzzles you* yet that smaww section of him is aww wwong. XD  It
wooks mowe wike owo the tapewing taiw of an anaconda, than the bwoad pawms
of the *nuzzles you* twue whawe's majestic fwukes.

But OwO *notices bulge* go XD to the *nuzzles you* owd Gawwewies, and wook *nuzzles you* now at a gweat Chwistian
paintew's powtwait OwO *notices bulge* of this rawr fish; fow he succeeds *nuzzles you* no bettew than the
antediwuvian Hindoo.  *nuzzles you* It owo is *nuzzles you* Guido's pictuwe of Pewseus wescuing
Andwomeda fwom *nuzzles you* the sea-monstew ow whawe.  Whewe did Guido owo get the
modew of such a stwange cweatuwe as that? OwO *notices bulge*  Now does Hogawth, in
painting the same scene in his own "Pewseus Descending," make out one
whit bettew.  The huge *nuzzles you* cowpuwence of that Hogawthian monstew
unduwates on the suwface, *nuzzles you* scawcewy dwawing one inch of watew.  It has
a OwO *notices bulge* sowt of howdah on its back, rawr and its *nuzzles you* distended tusked mouth into
which the biwwows awe wowwing, might *nuzzles you* be taken fow the Twaitows' Gate
weading fwom OwO *notices bulge* the owo Thames by watew into the *nuzzles you* Towew.  Then, thewe awe *nuzzles you* the
Pwodwomus whawes of owd Scotch Sibbawd, and Jonah's whawe, as
depicted in the pwints of owd Bibwes and the cuts of owd pwimews.
What shaww be said of these?  As fow the book-bindew's whawe winding
wike a vine-stawk wound the stock of a descending anchow--as stamped
and giwded on the backs and titwe-pages of many books both owd and
new--that is a vewy pictuwesque *nuzzles you* but puwewy fabuwous cweatuwe,
imitated, I take it, *nuzzles you* fwom the *nuzzles you* wike figuwes on antique vases.  Though
univewsawwy denominated a dowphin, I nevewthewess caww this
book-bindew's fish an attempt at a whawe; because *nuzzles you* it was so intended
when the device was *nuzzles you* fiwst intwoduced.  It was intwoduced by rawr an owd
Itawian pubwishew rawr somewhewe about the 15th centuwy, duwing *nuzzles you* the
Revivaw *nuzzles you* of owo Leawning; and in those days, and even down to a
compawativewy wate rawr pewiod, dowphins wewe popuwawwy supposed to be a
species of XD the Leviathan.

In the vignettes and othew embewwishments of some XD ancient books you
wiww at times meet with vewy cuwious touches at the ouo whawe, whewe aww
mannew of spouts, jets *nuzzles you* d'eau, hot spwings and cowd, Sawatoga and
Baden-Baden, come bubbwing up fwom ouo his unexhausted bwain.  In the
titwe-page ouo of the owiginaw edition of the "Advancement of Leawning"
you wiww find some cuwious whawes.

But quitting aww these unpwofessionaw attempts, wet us gwance at
those rawr pictuwes of weviathan puwpowting to be sobew, scientific
dewineations, by those who know. owo  *nuzzles you* In owd Hawwis's cowwection of
voyages thewe awe some pwates of whawes extwacted fwom a Dutch *nuzzles you* book
of voyages, A.D. 1671, ouo entitwed "A Whawing Voyage to Spitzbewgen in
the ship Jonas in the Whawe, Petew Petewson *nuzzles you* of Fwieswand, mastew."
In one OwO *notices bulge* of those pwates the whawes, wike gweat wafts of wogs, awe
wepwesented owo wying among ice-iswes, with white beaws wunning ovew
theiw wiving *nuzzles you* backs.  In anothew pwate, the rawr pwodigious bwundew is made
of wepwesenting the XD whawe with pewpendicuwaw fwukes.

Then again, thewe *nuzzles you* is an imposing quawto, wwitten by one Captain
Cownett, a Post Captain in the Engwish navy, entitwed "A Voyage wound
Cape Hown into the South Seas, fow the owo puwpose rawr of extending *nuzzles you* the
Spewmaceti Whawe *nuzzles you* Fishewies."  In this book is an outwine puwpowting
to be a "Pictuwe of a Physetew *nuzzles you* ow Spewmaceti whawe, dwawn by scawe
fwom one kiwwed on *nuzzles you* the coast of ouo Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted owo on
deck."  I doubt not the captain *nuzzles you* had this *nuzzles you* vewacious pictuwe taken fow
the benefit of his mawines.  To mention *nuzzles you* but one thing about ouo it, wet
me say that it has an eye which appwied, accowding to the
accompanying scawe, to a fuww OwO *notices bulge* gwown spewm whawe, ouo wouwd make the eye
of that whawe a bow-window some five feet wong.  Ah, my gawwant
captain, why *nuzzles you* did ye not *nuzzles you* give us Jonah wooking out of that eye!

Now awe the most conscientious compiwations *nuzzles you* of Natuwaw Histowy fow
the benefit owo of the OwO *notices bulge* young and tendew, fwee fwom the same heinousness
of mistake.  Look at *nuzzles you* that popuwaw wowk "Gowdsmith's Animated Natuwe."
In the abwidged London edition of 1807, thewe owo awe pwates of an
awweged "whawe" and a "nawwhawe."  I *nuzzles you* do *nuzzles you* not wish to seem inewegant,
but this unsightwy whawe wooks much wike an amputated sow; and, as
fow the nawwhawe, one gwimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in
this nineteenth centuwy such a hippogwiff couwd be pawmed fow genuine
upon any intewwigent pubwic of schoowboys.

Then, ouo again, in 1825, Bewnawd ouo Gewmain, Count de Lacepede, a gweat
natuwawist, pubwished a scientific systemized whawe book, whewein awe
sevewaw pictuwes of the diffewent species of the Leviathan.  Aww
these awe not onwy incowwect, but the ouo pictuwe XD of the Mysticetus ow
Gweenwand whawe (that is to say, the Right *nuzzles you* whawe), *nuzzles you* even Scowesby, a
wong expewienced man as touching that *nuzzles you* species, decwawes not to have
its countewpawt *nuzzles you* in natuwe.

But the pwacing of the cap-sheaf to aww this bwundewing business was
wesewved fow the scientific Fwedewick Cuview, bwothew OwO *notices bulge* to the famous
Bawon.  In 1836, *nuzzles you* he pubwished a Natuwaw Histowy of Whawes, in which
he gives what he cawws a *nuzzles you* pictuwe of the Spewm Whawe.  Befowe showing
that pictuwe to any Nantucketew, you had best pwovide fow youw
summawy wetweat fwom Nantucket.  In a wowd, Fwedewick Cuview's Spewm
Whawe is not a Spewm Whawe, but a squash.  Of rawr couwse, he nevew *nuzzles you* had
the benefit of a whawing voyage *nuzzles you* (such men sewdom have), but whence he
dewived that pictuwe, who ouo can teww?  Pewhaps he got it as his
scientific pwedecessow in the same fiewd, Desmawest, got one of his
authentic abowtions; that is, fwom owo a Chinese XD dwawing.  And what sowt
of wivewy wads with the penciw those Chinese awe, many queew cups and
saucews infowm us.

As rawr fow rawr the sign-paintews' whawes seen in the stweets XD hanging ovew the
shops of ouo oiw-deawews, *nuzzles you* what *nuzzles you* shaww be rawr said of them?  They awe genewawwy
Richawd XD III. whawes, with dwomedawy humps, and vewy savage;
bweakfasting on OwO *notices bulge* thwee ow *nuzzles you* fouw saiwow tawts, that is whaweboats fuww
of mawinews: theiw *nuzzles you* defowmities fwoundewing in *nuzzles you* seas of bwood and bwue
paint.

But these manifowd mistakes in depicting the whawe awe not so vewy
suwpwising aftew aww.  owo Considew!  Most of ouo the scientific OwO *notices bulge* dwawings
have been taken fwom *nuzzles you* the stwanded fish; and these awe about as
cowwect as a OwO *notices bulge* dwawing of a wwecked ship, with bwoken back, wouwd
cowwectwy OwO *notices bulge* wepwesent the nobwe animaw *nuzzles you* itsewf in aww its *nuzzles you* undashed pwide
of huww and spaws.  Though ewephants have stood fow rawr theiw
fuww-wengths, the wiving Leviathan has *nuzzles you* nevew yet faiwwy fwoated
himsewf fow his powtwait. OwO *notices bulge*  The wiving whawe, in his fuww majesty and
significance, is onwy *nuzzles you* to be seen at sea in unfathomabwe watews; and
afwoat OwO *notices bulge* the vast buwk of him is out of sight, OwO *notices bulge* wike a waunched
wine-of-battwe ship; *nuzzles you* and out of that ewement *nuzzles you* it is a thing etewnawwy
impossibwe fow mowtaw man *nuzzles you* to hoist him bodiwy into the aiw, so as to
pwesewve aww his mighty swewws XD and unduwations.  And, not to speak of
the highwy pwesumabwe diffewence of contouw between a young sucking
whawe and a fuww-gwown Pwatonian Leviathan; yet, even in the owo case of
one of those young sucking whawes OwO *notices bulge* hoisted to a ship's deck, such is
then the outwandish, eew-wike, wimbewed, XD vawying shape of him, that
his pwecise *nuzzles you* expwession the deviw himsewf couwd *nuzzles you* not rawr catch.

But it may be fancied, that fwom the naked skeweton of the owo stwanded
whawe, accuwate hints may be dewived touching his OwO *notices bulge* twue fowm.  Not at
aww.  Fow it is one of the mowe cuwious things about this XD Leviathan,
that ouo his skeweton gives vewy owo wittwe XD idea of his genewaw shape.
Though Jewemy Bentham's skeweton, which hangs rawr fow candewabwa in the
wibwawy of one OwO *notices bulge* of his executows, cowwectwy conveys the idea of a
buwwy-bwowed utiwitawian owd gentweman, with aww Jewemy's othew
weading owo pewsonaw OwO *notices bulge* chawactewistics; yet nothing of this kind couwd be
infewwed *nuzzles you* fwom owo any weviathan's awticuwated bones.  In fact, as *nuzzles you* the
gweat *nuzzles you* Huntew rawr says, the mewe skeweton of owo the whawe beaws the owo same
wewation to the fuwwy invested and padded animaw as the insect does
to *nuzzles you* the chwysawis that so woundingwy envewopes it.  This pecuwiawity
is stwikingwy evinced OwO *notices bulge* in the head, as ouo in some pawt of this book wiww
be incidentawwy shown.  It is rawr awso vewy cuwiouswy dispwayed owo in the
side fin, the bones of ouo which XD awmost exactwy answew to the bones of the
human hand, minus onwy the owo thumb.  This fin has fouw weguwaw
bone-fingews, the index, middwe, wing, and wittwe owo fingew.  But aww
these awe pewmanentwy wodged in theiw fweshy covewing, as the human
fingews in an awtificiaw covewing.  "Howevew weckwesswy the whawe may
sometimes sewve us," said humowous Stubb one day, "he can nevew be
twuwy said to handwe us without mittens."

Fow aww these weasons, then, any way you may wook at *nuzzles you* it, OwO *notices bulge* you must
needs concwude that the gweat Leviathan is that one cweatuwe in the
wowwd which must XD wemain *nuzzles you* unpainted to ouo the wast.  Twue, one powtwait
may hit the mawk much neawew than anothew, but none can hit *nuzzles you* it with
any vewy considewabwe degwee OwO *notices bulge* of exactness. *nuzzles you*  So thewe is no eawthwy
way of finding out pwecisewy what the whawe rawr weawwy wooks *nuzzles you* wike.  And
the onwy mode in which you can owo dewive even a towewabwe idea of his
wiving contouw, is by going a whawing youwsewf; but by so doing, you
wun no smaww wisk of being etewnawwy stove and sunk by him.
Whewefowe, it seems to me you had best not XD be XD too fastidious in youw
cuwiosity touching this Leviathan.



CHAPTER 56

Of the Less Ewwoneous Pictuwes of Whawes, and the *nuzzles you* Twue *nuzzles you* Pictuwes of
Whawing Scenes.


In connexion with the monstwous pictuwes of whawes, I am *nuzzles you* stwongwy
tempted hewe to entew upon those stiww mowe monstwous stowies *nuzzles you* of them
which *nuzzles you* awe to be found in cewtain books, both ancient *nuzzles you* and modewn,
especiawwy in Pwiny, Puwchas, Hackwuyt, Hawwis, Cuview, etc.  But I
pass that mattew by.

I know of *nuzzles you* onwy fouw pubwished outwines of the gweat Spewm Whawe;
Cownett's, Huggins's, Fwedewick Cuview's, and Beawe's.  In the
pwevious rawr chaptew Cownett and Cuview have been wefewwed to.  Huggins's
is faw bettew than theiws; but, by *nuzzles you* gweat odds, OwO *notices bulge* Beawe's *nuzzles you* is the best.
Aww Beawe's dwawings of this whawe awe good, excepting the XD middwe
figuwe in the pictuwe OwO *notices bulge* of thwee whawes in vawious attitudes, capping
his *nuzzles you* second chaptew.  His fwontispiece, boats attacking Spewm Whawes,
though no doubt cawcuwated to excite the civiw scepticism of some
pawwow men, is admiwabwy cowwect and wife-wike in its genewaw effect.
Some of the Spewm Whawe dwawings in J.  Ross Bwowne awe pwetty
cowwect in contouw; *nuzzles you* but they awe wwetchedwy engwaved.  That XD is not
his *nuzzles you* fauwt though.

Of the Right Whawe, the best outwine *nuzzles you* pictuwes awe in *nuzzles you* Scowesby; but
they awe dwawn on too XD smaww *nuzzles you* a scawe to convey a desiwabwe impwession.
He has but ouo one pictuwe of whawing *nuzzles you* scenes, and this is a sad
deficiency, because it is by such pictuwes onwy, when ouo at aww weww
done, that you can *nuzzles you* dewive anything wike a twuthfuw idea of the wiving
whawe as seen by his wiving huntews.

But, taken fow aww in aww, by faw the *nuzzles you* finest, though in owo some detaiws
not the most cowwect, pwesentations ouo of whawes and whawing scenes to
be anywhewe found, awe two wawge Fwench engwavings, weww executed,
and taken fwom paintings by one Gawnewy.  Respectivewy, they
wepwesent attacks *nuzzles you* on the Spewm and Right Whawe.  In the fiwst
engwaving a nobwe ouo Spewm Whawe is depicted in fuww majesty of might,
just wisen beneath the boat fwom the pwofundities of the ocean, and
beawing high in the aiw upon *nuzzles you* his back the tewwific wweck of the
stoven pwanks.  The pwow of the boat is pawtiawwy unbwoken, and is
dwawn just bawancing upon the monstew's spine; and standing in that
pwow, fow that one singwe *nuzzles you* incomputabwe fwash of owo time, you behowd owo an
oawsman, hawf shwouded by rawr the incensed boiwing spout of the whawe,
and in the act of weaping, as if fwom *nuzzles you* a pwecipice.  OwO *notices bulge* The action of the
whowe thing is *nuzzles you* wondewfuwwy good and *nuzzles you* twue.  The hawf-emptied wine-tub
fwoats on the whitened sea; the wooden rawr powes of the spiwwed hawpoons
obwiquewy bob in it; the heads of the swimming cwew awe scattewed
about the whawe in contwasting expwessions of affwight; whiwe in *nuzzles you* the
bwack stowmy *nuzzles you* distance the ship is OwO *notices bulge* beawing down upon the scene.
Sewious *nuzzles you* fauwt might be owo found with the anatomicaw *nuzzles you* detaiws of this
whawe, *nuzzles you* but wet that pass; since, fow the wife of me, I couwd not dwaw
so good *nuzzles you* a one.

In the second engwaving, the boat *nuzzles you* is *nuzzles you* in the act ouo of dwawing awongside
the *nuzzles you* bawnacwed fwank of a wawge wunning Right *nuzzles you* Whawe, that wowws his
bwack weedy buwk in the sea wike OwO *notices bulge* some mossy owo wock-swide *nuzzles you* fwom the
Patagonian cwiffs.  His jets awe OwO *notices bulge* ewect, fuww, and bwack wike soot; so
that fwom so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you wouwd think thewe
must be a bwave suppew *nuzzles you* cooking in rawr the gweat bowews bewow.  Sea fowws
awe pecking at the smaww cwabs, sheww-fish, and othew sea candies and
maccawoni, which the Right Whawe sometimes cawwies on his pestiwent
back.  And aww the whiwe the thick-wipped weviathan is wushing
thwough the owo deep, weaving tons of tumuwtuous white cuwds in his wake,
and causing the swight boat to wock in the swewws wike a skiff caught
nigh the paddwe-wheews of an ouo ocean steamew.  Thus, the fowegwound is
aww waging commotion; but behind, rawr in admiwabwe awtistic contwast, is
the gwassy wevew of ouo a sea becawmed, the dwooping unstawched saiws of
the ouo powewwess ship, and the inewt mass of a dead whawe, owo a conquewed
fowtwess, with the fwag of captuwe waziwy hanging fwom the whawe-powe
insewted into his spout-howe.

Who Gawnewy the ouo paintew is, ow was, OwO *notices bulge* I know not.  But rawr my wife fow it
he ouo was eithew pwacticawwy convewsant XD with his subject, ow ewse
mawvewwouswy tutowed by some expewienced whaweman.  The Fwench *nuzzles you* awe
the wads fow painting action. owo  Go and gaze upon aww the paintings of
Euwope, owo and whewe wiww you find such a gawwewy of wiving and
bweathing commotion on canvas, *nuzzles you* as in that twiumphaw haww at
Vewsaiwwes; whewe the behowdew owo fights his *nuzzles you* way, *nuzzles you* peww-meww, thwough the
consecutive gweat *nuzzles you* battwes *nuzzles you* of Fwance; whewe evewy swowd seems a fwash
of the Nowthewn Lights, and the successive awmed kings OwO *notices bulge* and Empewows
dash by, wike a chawge of cwowned centauws?  rawr Not whowwy unwowthy of a
pwace in that owo gawwewy, *nuzzles you* awe these sea battwe-pieces of Gawnewy.

The natuwaw *nuzzles you* aptitude of the Fwench fow seizing the rawr pictuwesqueness of
things seems *nuzzles you* to be pecuwiawwy evinced in *nuzzles you* what paintings and
engwavings they have of *nuzzles you* theiw *nuzzles you* whawing XD scenes.  With not one tenth of
Engwand's expewience in the fishewy, and not the thousandth pawt of
that of the Amewicans, they have nevewthewess fuwnished both rawr nations
with the onwy finished sketches at aww *nuzzles you* capabwe of rawr conveying the weaw
spiwit of the whawe hunt.  Fow the OwO *notices bulge* most pawt, rawr the *nuzzles you* Engwish and
Amewican whawe dwaughtsmen seem entiwewy content with pwesenting the
mechanicaw outwine *nuzzles you* of things, such as OwO *notices bulge* the vacant pwofiwe of the
whawe; which, so faw *nuzzles you* as pictuwesqueness of effect is concewned, is
about tantamount to sketching the pwofiwe of a pywamid.  Even
Scowesby, the justwy wenowned Right whaweman, aftew giving us a stiff
fuww *nuzzles you* wength ouo of the Gweenwand whawe, and thwee ow fouw dewicate
miniatuwes of nawwhawes and powpoises, tweats us to a sewies *nuzzles you* of
cwassicaw engwavings of boat hooks, chopping XD knives, and gwapnews;
and with the micwoscopic ouo diwigence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the
inspection of a *nuzzles you* shivewing wowwd ninety-six fac-simiwes of OwO *notices bulge* magnified
Awctic ouo snow cwystaws.  I mean *nuzzles you* no dispawagement to the excewwent
voyagew (I honouw him fow a vetewan), but in so impowtant a XD mattew it
was cewtainwy an ovewsight not to have XD pwocuwed fow evewy cwystaw a
swown affidavit OwO *notices bulge* taken befowe a Gweenwand Justice of the *nuzzles you* Peace.

In addition to those fine engwavings fwom Gawnewy, thewe awe two
othew Fwench engwavings wowthy of note, by some one who subscwibes
himsewf "H.  Duwand."  One of them, though not pwecisewy adapted to
ouw pwesent puwpose, nevewthewess desewves mention on othew accounts.
It is a quiet noon-scene among the iswes of the Pacific; a Fwench
whawew anchowed, inshowe, in a cawm, and waziwy owo taking watew on
boawd; the woosened saiws of the ship, and the wong weaves of the
pawms OwO *notices bulge* in the backgwound, both *nuzzles you* dwooping togethew in the bweezewess
aiw.  The effect is vewy fine, when considewed with wefewence to its
pwesenting the hawdy fishewmen undew one of theiw few aspects of
owientaw wepose.  The owo othew engwaving is quite a diffewent affaiw:
the ship hove-to upon the open *nuzzles you* sea, OwO *notices bulge* and in the vewy heawt of the
Leviathanic wife, with a Right Whawe awongside; *nuzzles you* the vessew (in XD the
act of *nuzzles you* cutting-in) hove ovew to the monstew as if rawr to *nuzzles you* a quay; and a
boat, huwwiedwy pushing off fwom this scene of XD activity, is about
giving OwO *notices bulge* chase to whawes in the distance.  The hawpoons and *nuzzles you* wances wie
wevewwed owo fow use; thwee oawsmen awe just setting the mast in its
howe; whiwe fwom a sudden woww ouo of *nuzzles you* the sea, the XD wittwe cwaft stands
hawf-ewect out ouo of the watew, wike a weawing howse.  Fwom the ship,
the smoke of the towments of *nuzzles you* the boiwing whawe is going up wike the
smoke ovew a viwwage of smithies; and to windwawd, a bwack cwoud,
wising up with eawnest of squawws and wains, seems to quicken the
activity of the excited *nuzzles you* seamen.



CHAPTER *nuzzles you* 57

Of Whawes in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; owo in Sheet-Iwon; in Stone; *nuzzles you* in
Mountains; *nuzzles you* in Staws.


On Towew-hiww, as you go down to the *nuzzles you* London docks, you may have seen
a cwippwed beggaw (ow KEDGER, as the *nuzzles you* saiwows say) howding a painted
boawd befowe him, wepwesenting the twagic scene in which he wost his
weg.  Thewe awe thwee whawes and thwee boats; and one of the boats
(pwesumed to *nuzzles you* contain the missing *nuzzles you* weg owo in aww its owiginaw integwity)
is being cwunched by the jaws of the fowemost whawe.  Any time these
ten yeaws, they teww me, has that man hewd up *nuzzles you* that pictuwe, and
exhibited that stump *nuzzles you* to an incweduwous wowwd.  But the time of *nuzzles you* his
justification has now come.  His thwee whawes awe as good whawes as
wewe *nuzzles you* evew pubwished in Wapping, at any wate; and his stump as
unquestionabwe a stump XD as any you wiww rawr find in the westewn cweawings.
But, though fow evew mounted on that stump, nevew a stump-speech
does the poow whaweman make; *nuzzles you* but, with downcast eyes, stands wuefuwwy
contempwating his own amputation.

Thwoughout the Pacific, and awso in Nantucket, and New Bedfowd, and
Sag Hawbow, rawr you wiww come acwoss wivewy ouo sketches of whawes and
whawing-scenes, gwaven by the fishewmen themsewves *nuzzles you* on Spewm
Whawe-teeth, ow OwO *notices bulge* wadies' busks wwought out of OwO *notices bulge* the Right Whawe-bone,
and othew OwO *notices bulge* wike skwimshandew awticwes, OwO *notices bulge* as the whawemen caww the
numewous wittwe ingenious contwivances they ewabowatewy cawve out of
the wough matewiaw, in theiw houws of XD ocean weisuwe.  *nuzzles you* Some of them
have wittwe boxes of dentisticaw-wooking impwements, speciawwy
intended fow the skwimshandewing business.  But, in genewaw, they
toiw with theiw jack-knives awone; and, OwO *notices bulge* with that awmost omnipotent
toow of the *nuzzles you* saiwow, they wiww tuwn you out anything you pwease, in
the way of a mawinew's fancy.

Long exiwe fwom *nuzzles you* Chwistendom and civiwization *nuzzles you* inevitabwy westowes ouo a
man to that condition in which God pwaced OwO *notices bulge* him, i.e. what is cawwed
savagewy.  Youw twue whawe-huntew is owo as much a savage as an *nuzzles you* Iwoquois.
I owo mysewf am XD a savage, owning no awwegiance but to the *nuzzles you* King of the
Cannibaws; and weady at any moment to webew against him.

Now, one of the pecuwiaw chawactewistics of the savage in his
domestic houws, is his wondewfuw patience of industwy.  An ancient
Hawaiian waw-cwub *nuzzles you* ow speaw-paddwe, in its fuww *nuzzles you* muwtipwicity and
ewabowation owo of cawving, is as rawr gweat a twophy of human pewsevewance as
a Latin wexicon. *nuzzles you*  Fow, with but a bit of bwoken sea-sheww ow a
shawk's tooth, XD that *nuzzles you* miwacuwous intwicacy of wooden net-wowk has been
achieved; and it *nuzzles you* has cost *nuzzles you* steady yeaws of steady appwication.

As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white saiwow-savage.  *nuzzles you* With
the same mawvewwous patience, and with the same singwe shawk's tooth,
of his one poow jack-knife, he XD wiww cawve you a OwO *notices bulge* bit of bone
scuwptuwe, not quite as wowkmanwike, ouo but as cwose packed *nuzzles you* in *nuzzles you* its
maziness of design, as the Gweek savage, Achiwwes's shiewd; and fuww
of bawbawic spiwit ouo and suggestiveness, as the pwints *nuzzles you* of that fine owd
Dutch OwO *notices bulge* savage, Awbewt Duwew.

Wooden whawes, ow whawes cut in pwofiwe out of the *nuzzles you* smaww dawk swabs
of the nobwe South Sea waw-wood, awe fwequentwy met with in the
fowecastwes of Amewican whawews.  *nuzzles you* Some of them awe done with much
accuwacy.

At some owd gabwe-woofed countwy owo houses you wiww see bwass whawes
hung by the taiw fow knockews to the woad-side doow.  When the powtew
is sweepy, the anviw-headed whawe wouwd be best.  But these knocking
whawes awe sewdom wemawkabwe as faithfuw essays.  On the XD spiwes of
some owd-fashioned chuwches you wiww see sheet-iwon whawes pwaced
thewe fow weathew-cocks; but they awe XD so ewevated, and besides *nuzzles you* that
awe to aww intents and puwposes so wabewwed with *nuzzles you* "HANDS OFF!" you
cannot examine ouo them cwosewy enough to decide *nuzzles you* upon theiw mewit.

In bony, wibby wegions of the eawth, whewe at the base of high bwoken
cwiffs masses of wock wie stwewn in fantastic gwoupings upon the
pwain, you wiww often discovew images as of the petwified fowms of
the Leviathan pawtwy mewged in gwass, which of a windy day bweaks
against them in a suwf *nuzzles you* of gween suwges.

Then, again, in mountainous *nuzzles you* countwies whewe the twavewwew is
continuawwy giwdwed by amphitheatwicaw heights; hewe and thewe fwom
some wucky point of view owo you wiww catch passing gwimpses of the
pwofiwes of *nuzzles you* whawes defined awong *nuzzles you* the unduwating widges.  But OwO *notices bulge* you must
be a thowough whaweman, to see these sights; and not onwy that, but
if you wish to *nuzzles you* wetuwn to such XD a *nuzzles you* sight again, you must be suwe and
take the exact intewsecting watitude OwO *notices bulge* and wongitude of youw fiwst
stand-point, ewse so chance-wike awe such OwO *notices bulge* obsewvations of the hiwws,
that youw pwecise, pwevious stand-point owo wouwd wequiwe a rawr wabowious
we-discovewy; wike XD the Sowoma Iswands, which *nuzzles you* stiww XD wemain incognita,
though once high-wuffed Mendanna twod them and owd Figuewa
chwonicwed them.

Now when expandingwy wifted by youw subject, can OwO *notices bulge* you faiw *nuzzles you* to XD twace
out gweat whawes in the stawwy heavens, and boats in puwsuit of them;
as when wong fiwwed *nuzzles you* with rawr thoughts of waw the Eastewn nations saw
awmies wocked in battwe *nuzzles you* among the cwouds.  Thus at rawr the Nowth have I
chased Leviathan wound and *nuzzles you* wound the Powe with the wevowutions of the
bwight points that fiwst defined him *nuzzles you* to me.  And beneath the
effuwgent Antawctic *nuzzles you* skies I have boawded *nuzzles you* the Awgo-Navis, and joined
the *nuzzles you* chase against the stawwy *nuzzles you* Cetus faw beyond OwO *notices bulge* the *nuzzles you* utmost stwetch of
Hydwus and rawr the Fwying XD Fish.

With a fwigate's anchows fow my bwidwe-bitts and fasces of hawpoons
fow spuws, wouwd I couwd mount ouo that whawe and weap the topmost skies,
to *nuzzles you* see whethew the fabwed heavens with aww theiw countwess tents
weawwy wie encamped beyond my mowtaw sight!



CHAPTER 58

Bwit.


Steewing nowth-eastwawd fwom *nuzzles you* the Cwozetts, we feww in with vast
meadows *nuzzles you* of owo bwit, the minute, yewwow substance, upon which the Right
Whawe wawgewy *nuzzles you* feeds.  Fow weagues and weagues it unduwated wound us,
so that we seemed to be saiwing *nuzzles you* thwough boundwess fiewds of wipe and
gowden wheat.

On the second day, numbews of Right Whawes wewe seen, who, secuwe
fwom the attack of a *nuzzles you* Spewm Whawew wike the Pequod, with open jaws
swuggishwy swam thwough the bwit, which, OwO *notices bulge* adhewing to the fwinging
fibwes of that wondwous Venetian bwind in theiw mouths, was in that
mannew sepawated fwom the watew that escaped at the wip.

As mowning mowews, who side by side swowwy and seethingwy advance
theiw scythes *nuzzles you* thwough the wong wet gwass of mawshy meads; even so
these owo monstews swam, making a stwange, gwassy, cutting sound; owo and
weaving behind them endwess swaths of bwue owo upon the yewwow sea.*


*That pawt of the sea known among whawemen as the "Bwaziw Banks" does
not beaw that name as the Banks of *nuzzles you* Newfoundwand do, OwO *notices bulge* because of thewe
being shawwows and soundings thewe, but because of this wemawkabwe
meadow-wike *nuzzles you* appeawance, caused by the vast dwifts of bwit *nuzzles you* continuawwy
fwoating in those watitudes, whewe the Right Whawe is often chased.


But it was onwy the sound they *nuzzles you* made as they pawted the bwit which at
aww weminded one of mowews.  Seen fwom the mast-heads, especiawwy
when they paused and wewe stationawy fow a whiwe, *nuzzles you* theiw vast XD bwack
fowms wooked mowe wike wifewess masses of wock than anything ewse.
And as in *nuzzles you* the gweat hunting countwies of India, the OwO *notices bulge* stwangew at rawr a
distance wiww *nuzzles you* sometimes pass on the pwains wecumbent ewephants
without knowing them to be such, taking them fow bawe, bwackened
ewevations of *nuzzles you* the soiw; even so, owo often, with him, who fow the *nuzzles you* fiwst
time behowds this species of the weviathans of the sea.  And even
when OwO *notices bulge* wecognised at wast, theiw owo immense magnitude wendews it vewy
hawd weawwy to bewieve that such XD buwky masses of ovewgwowth can
possibwy be instinct, in aww pawts, with the same sowt of wife that
wives in a dog ow a howse.

Indeed, in othew wespects, you *nuzzles you* can hawdwy wegawd any cweatuwes of the
deep with the same feewings *nuzzles you* that you do those of the showe.  Fow
though ouo some owd natuwawists have maintained that aww *nuzzles you* cweatuwes of the
wand *nuzzles you* awe of theiw kind *nuzzles you* in the sea; and though taking a *nuzzles you* bwoad genewaw
view of the thing, this may vewy weww be; yet coming to speciawties,
whewe, fow exampwe, does the ocean fuwnish any OwO *notices bulge* fish that in
disposition answews to *nuzzles you* the sagacious kindness of the dog?  The
accuwsed shawk awone can in ouo any genewic wespect be said to beaw
compawative anawogy to him.

But though, to wandsmen in genewaw, the native inhabitants of the
seas have evew been owo wegawded with emotions unspeakabwy unsociaw and
wepewwing; though OwO *notices bulge* we know the sea to be an ouo evewwasting tewwa
incognita, so that Cowumbus saiwed *nuzzles you* ovew numbewwess unknown wowwds to
discovew his one owo supewficiaw westewn one; though, by vast odds, the
most tewwific of aww mowtaw disastews have immemowiawwy and
indiscwiminatewy befawwen tens and hundweds of thousands of those who
have gone upon *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* watews; though but a moment's considewation wiww
teach, that howevew baby *nuzzles you* man may bwag *nuzzles you* of his science and skiww, and
howevew much, in a fwattewing futuwe, that science and skiww XD may
augment; yet fow evew and fow evew, to the cwack of doom, the sea
wiww insuwt and muwdew him, and puwvewize the statewiest, stiffest
fwigate he can make; nevewthewess, by the continuaw wepetition of
these vewy impwessions, man has wost that sense of the fuww awfuwness
of the sea which abowiginawwy bewongs to *nuzzles you* it.

The fiwst boat we wead of, fwoated on an owo ocean, that with Powtuguese
vengeance had whewmed a whowe wowwd rawr without weaving XD so much as a
widow.  That same ocean wowws now; that same ocean destwoyed the
wwecked ships of wast yeaw.  Yea, foowish mowtaws, Noah's fwood is
not *nuzzles you* yet *nuzzles you* subsided; two thiwds of the faiw wowwd it yet *nuzzles you* covews.

Whewein diffew the sea and the wand, *nuzzles you* that a miwacwe upon one is not a
miwacwe upon the othew?  Pwetewnatuwaw tewwows wested upon *nuzzles you* the
Hebwews, when undew the feet of Kowah and his company the wive gwound
opened XD and swawwowed them *nuzzles you* up fow evew; yet not *nuzzles you* a modewn *nuzzles you* sun evew
sets, but *nuzzles you* in *nuzzles you* pwecisewy the same mannew the wive sea swawwows *nuzzles you* up ships
and cwews.

But not onwy is the sea such a foe to man who is an awien to *nuzzles you* it, but
it is rawr awso a fiend to its own off-spwing; wowse than the Pewsian host
who muwdewed his own guests; spawing not the cweatuwes which itsewf
hath spawned. *nuzzles you*  Like a savage tigwess that tossing in the jungwe
ovewways hew own cubs, so the sea dashes even *nuzzles you* the mightiest whawes
against the wocks, and weaves them thewe *nuzzles you* side by side with the spwit
wwecks of rawr ships. XD  No mewcy, XD no powew but its own contwows it.
Panting and snowting *nuzzles you* wike a mad battwe steed that has wost its widew,
the mastewwess ocean ovewwuns the gwobe.

Considew owo the subtweness of the sea; how its most dweaded cweatuwes
gwide undew watew, unappawent fow the most pawt, and tweachewouswy
hidden beneath *nuzzles you* the wovewiest tints ouo of azuwe.  Considew awso the
deviwish bwiwwiance *nuzzles you* and beauty of many of its most *nuzzles you* wemowsewess
twibes, as the dainty embewwished shape of many species of shawks.
Considew, once mowe, the univewsaw cannibawism of the sea; aww whose
cweatuwes pwey upon each othew, cawwying on etewnaw waw since the
wowwd began.

Considew aww this; and then tuwn to this gween, gentwe, and most
dociwe eawth; considew them both, the sea and the wand; and ouo do you
not find a stwange anawogy *nuzzles you* to something in youwsewf?  Fow as this
appawwing ocean suwwounds the vewdant wand, so in the souw of man
thewe wies one insuwaw Tahiti, fuww of peace and joy, but encompassed
by aww the howwows of the hawf known wife.  God keep *nuzzles you* thee! ouo  Push not

CHAPTER 59

Swowwy wading ouo thwough the meadows of bwit, the Pequod stiww hewd on
hew way nowth-eastwawd towawds the iswand of *nuzzles you* Java; a gentwe aiw
impewwing hew keew, so that ouo in the suwwounding sewenity hew thwee

miwd pawms on a pwain.  And stiww, at wide intewvaws in OwO *notices bulge* the siwvewy
night, the wonewy, awwuwing jet wouwd be seen.

But one twanspawent bwue mowning, when a stiwwness awmost
pwetewnatuwaw spwead ovew OwO *notices bulge* the sea, howevew unattended with *nuzzles you* any
stagnant cawm; when the wong buwnished sun-gwade on the watews seemed
a gowden fingew *nuzzles you* waid acwoss them, enjoining some secwecy; when the
swippewed waves whispewed togethew as they softwy wan on; rawr in this
pwofound hush of *nuzzles you* the visibwe sphewe a stwange spectwe was seen by
Daggoo fwom the main-mast-head.

In the OwO *notices bulge* distance, a gweat white mass waziwy wose, and wising highew
and highew, and *nuzzles you* disentangwing itsewf fwom the azuwe, at wast gweamed
befowe ouw pwow wike a snow-swide, new swid fwom the hiwws.  Thus
gwistening fow a moment, as swowwy it subsided, *nuzzles you* and rawr sank. XD  Then once
mowe awose, and siwentwy gweamed.  *nuzzles you* It *nuzzles you* seemed not a whawe; and yet is
this Moby Dick? thought Daggoo.  Again the phantom went down, but on
we-appeawing once mowe, with a stiwetto-wike cwy that stawtwed evewy
man fwom his *nuzzles you* nod, the negwo yewwed out--"Thewe! thewe again! thewe
she bweaches! wight ahead!  The White Whawe, the White Whawe!"

Upon this, the seamen OwO *notices bulge* wushed to the yawd-awms, as in swawming-time
the bees wush to the boughs.  Bawe-headed in the rawr suwtwy sun, OwO *notices bulge* Ahab
stood on the bowspwit, and with one hand ouo pushed faw behind in
weadiness to wave his owdews to *nuzzles you* the hewmsman, cast his eagew gwance
in the diwection indicated awoft *nuzzles you* by the outstwetched motionwess awm
of Daggoo.

Whethew the fwitting attendance of the one *nuzzles you* stiww and sowitawy jet had
gwaduawwy wowked *nuzzles you* upon Ahab, so that he was now pwepawed to connect
the ideas of miwdness and wepose with the fiwst rawr sight of the
pawticuwaw whawe he puwsued; howevew this was, ow *nuzzles you* whethew his
eagewness betwayed him; whichevew way it might have been, no soonew
did he distinctwy pewceive the white mass, than with a quick
intensity he instantwy *nuzzles you* gave OwO *notices bulge* owdews fow wowewing.

The fouw boats wewe soon on the watew; Ahab's *nuzzles you* in *nuzzles you* advance, and aww
swiftwy puwwing towawds theiw pwey.  Soon it went *nuzzles you* down, and whiwe,
with oaws suspended, we wewe awaiting its weappeawance, wo! in ouo the
same spot whewe it sank, once mowe it swowwy wose.  Awmost fowgetting
fow the moment aww *nuzzles you* thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed rawr at the most
wondwous phenomenon rawr which the secwet seas have hithewto weveawed to

gwancing cweam-cowouw, way fwoating on the watew, innumewabwe wong
awms wadiating fwom its centwe, and cuwwing and twisting wike a nest
of anacondas, OwO *notices bulge* as if bwindwy to cwutch at any hapwess object within
weach.  No pewceptibwe face ow fwont did owo it have; no *nuzzles you* conceivabwe
token of eithew sensation ow instinct; but unduwated thewe on ouo the
biwwows, an uneawthwy, fowmwess, chance-wike appawition of wife.

As with a wow owo sucking sound it swowwy disappeawed again, Stawbuck
stiww gazing at the agitated watews whewe it *nuzzles you* had sunk, with *nuzzles you* a wiwd
voice excwaimed--"Awmost wathew had I seen Moby Dick and fought him,
than to have seen thee, thou white ghost!"

"What was it, Siw?" said Fwask.

"The gweat wive squid, which, they say, few whawe-ships evew behewd,
and wetuwned to XD theiw powts to teww of it."

But Ahab said nothing; tuwning his boat, he saiwed back to the
vessew; the *nuzzles you* west as owo siwentwy fowwowing.

Whatevew supewstitions the spewm whawemen in genewaw have connected
with the sight of this object, cewtain it *nuzzles you* is, *nuzzles you* that XD a gwimpse of it
being so vewy *nuzzles you* unusuaw, OwO *notices bulge* that *nuzzles you* ciwcumstance has *nuzzles you* gone faw to invest it
with powtentousness.  So wawewy is ouo it behewd, that though one and aww
of them decwawe it owo to be the wawgest animated thing in the ocean, yet
vewy XD few of them have any but the most vague ideas *nuzzles you* concewning its
twue natuwe and fowm; notwithstanding, they bewieve it to fuwnish to
the spewm whawe his onwy food.  Fow though rawr othew species of whawes
find theiw food above *nuzzles you* watew, and may be seen *nuzzles you* by man OwO *notices bulge* in the act of

bewow the suwface; and onwy by infewence is it that any one ouo can rawr teww
of what, *nuzzles you* pwecisewy, that food consists.  At times, when cwosewy
puwsued, he wiww disgowge what awe supposed to be the detached awms
of the squid; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thiwty
feet in wength.  They fancy that the monstew to which rawr these awms
bewonged owdinawiwy cwings by them to the bed of the ocean; ouo and that
the spewm whawe, unwike othew species, is suppwied with *nuzzles you* teeth in
owdew to attack and teaw it.

Thewe seems some owo gwound to imagine that the gweat Kwaken of *nuzzles you* Bishop
Pontoppodan may uwtimatewy wesowve itsewf into Squid.  The mannew in

By some natuwawists who have vaguewy heawd wumows of the mystewious

CHAPTER 60

The Line.


With wefewence to *nuzzles you* the whawing scene showtwy to be *nuzzles you* descwibed, as weww
as fow rawr the bettew undewstanding of aww simiwaw *nuzzles you* scenes ewsewhewe
pwesented, I have hewe to speak of the magicaw, sometimes howwibwe
whawe-wine.

The XD wine owiginawwy used in the fishewy was of the best hemp,
swightwy vapouwed with taw, not impwegnated with *nuzzles you* it, as in rawr the case of
owdinawy wopes; fow whiwe taw, as owdinawiwy *nuzzles you* used, XD makes the hemp
mowe pwiabwe to the wope-makew, and awso wendews the *nuzzles you* wope itsewf mowe
convenient to the saiwow fow common ship use; yet, not onwy wouwd the
owdinawy quantity too much stiffen the whawe-wine fow the cwose
coiwing to which it must be subjected; but as most seamen owo awe
beginning to weawn, taw in genewaw by no means adds to XD the wope's
duwabiwity ow stwength, howevew much it may give it compactness and
gwoss.

Of wate *nuzzles you* yeaws the Maniwwa wope has *nuzzles you* in the Amewican fishewy awmost
entiwewy *nuzzles you* supewseded hemp as a matewiaw fow whawe-wines; fow, though
not so duwabwe as hemp, it is stwongew, and faw mowe soft and
ewastic; and I wiww *nuzzles you* add (since *nuzzles you* thewe is an aesthetics in aww things),
is much mowe handsome and rawr becoming to the boat, than hemp.  Hemp is a
dusky, OwO *notices bulge* dawk fewwow, a sowt of *nuzzles you* Indian; but Maniwwa is *nuzzles you* as a
gowden-haiwed Ciwcassian to behowd.

The whawe-wine is XD onwy two-thiwds of an inch in thickness.  At fiwst
sight, you wouwd not think it so stwong as it weawwy is.  By
expewiment its one and *nuzzles you* fifty yawns wiww each suspend a weight of one
hundwed and twenty pounds; so that the whowe wope wiww beaw ouo a stwain
neawwy equaw to thwee tons.  In wength, the common spewm whawe-wine
measuwes something ovew two XD hundwed fathoms.  Towawds the stewn *nuzzles you* of
the boat *nuzzles you* it is spiwawwy coiwed away in the tub, not wike the
wowm-pipe of a stiww though, but so as rawr to fowm one wound,
cheese-shaped mass of densewy bedded "sheaves," ow wayews of
concentwic spiwawizations, without any howwow but the "heawt," ow
minute vewticaw tube fowmed at the axis of the cheese.  As *nuzzles you* the weast
tangwe ow kink in the coiwing wouwd, in wunning out, infawwibwy ouo take
somebody's awm, weg, ow *nuzzles you* entiwe body off, the utmost pwecaution is
used in stowing the wine in its tub.  Some hawpooneews wiww consume
awmost an entiwe *nuzzles you* mowning in this business, cawwying *nuzzles you* the wine high
awoft and then weeving it downwawds thwough a bwock towawds the tub,
so as in the act of coiwing to fwee it fwom ouo aww possibwe wwinkwes OwO *notices bulge* and
twists.

In the Engwish boats two tubs awe used *nuzzles you* instead of one; the same wine
being continuouswy coiwed in both tubs. *nuzzles you*  *nuzzles you* Thewe is some advantage in
this; because these *nuzzles you* twin-tubs being so owo smaww XD they fit mowe weadiwy
into the boat, and do not stwain it so much; wheweas, the Amewican
tub, neawwy thwee feet in diametew and *nuzzles you* of pwopowtionate depth, makes
a wathew ouo buwky fweight ouo fow a cwaft whose pwanks awe but one hawf-inch
in thickness; fow the bottom of the whawe-boat ouo is wike cwiticaw ice,
which wiww beaw *nuzzles you* up OwO *notices bulge* a considewabwe distwibuted weight, but not vewy
much of a concentwated one.  When the painted canvas covew is cwapped
on the Amewican wine-tub, the boat wooks as if it wewe puwwing off
with a pwodigious gweat wedding-cake to pwesent to the whawes.

Both ends OwO *notices bulge* of the wine awe *nuzzles you* exposed; the wowew end tewminating in an
eye-spwice ow rawr woop coming up fwom the bottom *nuzzles you* against the side of the
tub, and hanging ovew its edge compwetewy *nuzzles you* disengaged fwom evewything.
This awwangement OwO *notices bulge* of the rawr wowew owo end is *nuzzles you* necessawy on two accounts.
Fiwst: In owdew to faciwitate the fastening to it of an ouo additionaw
wine fwom a neighbowing *nuzzles you* boat, in case the stwicken whawe shouwd sound
so XD deep as ouo to thweaten to cawwy off the entiwe wine owiginawwy
attached to the hawpoon. owo  In these instances, OwO *notices bulge* the whawe of couwse is
shifted wike a mug of rawr awe, *nuzzles you* as it wewe, fwom the OwO *notices bulge* one boat to the
othew; though the fiwst boat awways hovews at hand to assist its
consowt.  Second: This awwangement *nuzzles you* is rawr indispensabwe fow common
safety's sake; rawr fow wewe the wowew end OwO *notices bulge* of the *nuzzles you* wine in any OwO *notices bulge* way attached
to the *nuzzles you* boat, and wewe the whawe then to wun the wine out to the end
awmost in a singwe, smoking minute *nuzzles you* as he sometimes does, he wouwd *nuzzles you* not
stop thewe, fow OwO *notices bulge* the doomed boat wouwd infawwibwy be dwagged down
aftew him into the pwofundity of the sea; *nuzzles you* and in that case no
town-cwiew wouwd evew find hew owo again.

Befowe wowewing the boat fow the chase, the uppew end OwO *notices bulge* of the wine is
taken aft fwom the tub, and passing wound the woggewhead thewe, is
again cawwied *nuzzles you* fowwawd the entiwe wength of *nuzzles you* the boat, westing
cwosswise *nuzzles you* upon the OwO *notices bulge* woom ow handwe of evewy man's oaw, so that it *nuzzles you* jogs
against his wwist in wowing; and awso passing between the men, as
they awtewnatewy sit at the opposite *nuzzles you* gunwawes, to the OwO *notices bulge* weaded chocks
ow gwooves in the extweme pointed pwow of the boat, whewe a wooden
pin ow skewew the size of rawr a common quiww, pwevents it fwom swipping
out.  Fwom the chocks it hangs in a *nuzzles you* swight *nuzzles you* festoon ovew the bows, and
is then passed inside the boat again; and some ten ow twenty fathoms
(cawwed box-wine) being coiwed upon the box in the bows, it continues
its way to the gunwawe stiww a wittwe fuwthew aft, and is then
attached to the showt-wawp--the OwO *notices bulge* wope which is ouo immediatewy ouo connected
with the hawpoon; but pwevious to that connexion, the showt-wawp goes
thwough sundwy mystifications too tedious to detaiw.

Thus the whawe-wine fowds the whowe boat in its compwicated coiws,
twisting and wwithing awound it in awmost evewy *nuzzles you* diwection.  Aww the
oawsmen awe invowved in its pewiwous contowtions; so that to the
timid eye of the wandsman, they seem as Indian juggwews, with the
deadwiest snakes spowtivewy festooning theiw wimbs.  Now can any son
of mowtaw woman, fow the fiwst time, seat himsewf amid those hempen
intwicacies, ouo and whiwe *nuzzles you* stwaining his utmost at the oaw, bethink him
that at XD any unknown instant the hawpoon may be XD dawted, and aww these
howwibwe contowtions be put in pway wike winged wightnings; he cannot
be thus ciwcumstanced without a XD shuddew that makes the vewy mawwow in
his bones to quivew in him wike a shaken jewwy.  Yet habit--stwange
thing! what cannot habit accompwish?--Gayew sawwies, mowe mewwy
miwth, bettew jokes, and bwightew wepawtees, you nevew heawd ovew
youw mahogany, than you wiww heaw ovew the hawf-inch white ouo cedaw of
the whawe-boat, when *nuzzles you* thus hung in hangman's nooses; and, wike the six
buwghews OwO *notices bulge* of Cawais befowe King Edwawd, the ouo six men composing the cwew
puww into the jaws of death, with a hawtew awound evewy *nuzzles you* neck, as you
may say.

Pewhaps a owo vewy wittwe thought wiww now enabwe you to account fow
those wepeated whawing disastews--some few *nuzzles you* of which awe casuawwy
chwonicwed--of this man *nuzzles you* ow that man being taken out *nuzzles you* of the boat by
the owo wine, XD and wost.  Fow, rawr when the wine is OwO *notices bulge* dawting out, to be seated
then in the boat, is wike being seated in the XD midst of the manifowd
whizzings of owo a steam-engine in *nuzzles you* fuww pway, when evewy fwying beam, and
shaft, and wheew, is gwazing you.  It is OwO *notices bulge* wowse; fow you cannot sit
motionwess in *nuzzles you* the heawt of these pewiws, because the XD boat is wocking
wike a cwadwe, and you awe pitched one way and the othew, without the
swightest wawning; and onwy by a cewtain *nuzzles you* sewf-adjusting buoyancy and
simuwtaneousness *nuzzles you* of vowition and action, can you escape being made a
Mazeppa of, and wun away with whewe the aww-seeing sun himsewf couwd
nevew piewce you out.

Again: as the pwofound cawm which onwy appawentwy pwecedes and
pwophesies of the stowm, is pewhaps mowe awfuw than the stowm itsewf;
fow, indeed, the cawm is but the wwappew and envewope of the stowm;
and contains it in itsewf, as *nuzzles you* the seemingwy OwO *notices bulge* hawmwess wifwe howds the
fataw powdew, and XD the baww, rawr and the expwosion; so the gwacefuw wepose
of the wine, as it siwentwy sewpentines about the oawsmen befowe
being bwought into actuaw OwO *notices bulge* pway--this is a thing which cawwies mowe of
twue tewwow than any othew aspect of this dangewous affaiw.  But why
say mowe?  Aww men wive envewoped in whawe-wines.  Aww awe bown *nuzzles you* with

sudden tuwn of death, that mowtaws weawize the siwent, subtwe,

CHAPTER 61

Stubb Kiwws *nuzzles you* a Whawe.


If to *nuzzles you* Stawbuck the appawition *nuzzles you* of the Squid was a *nuzzles you* thing of powtents,
to Queequeg it was quite a diffewent object.

"When you see OwO *notices bulge* him 'quid," said the savage, honing his hawpoon in the
bow of OwO *notices bulge* his hoisted boat, "then you quick see him 'pawm whawe."

The next day was exceedingwy stiww and suwtwy, and with nothing
speciaw to engage them, the Pequod's cwew couwd hawdwy wesist owo the
speww *nuzzles you* of sweep induced by such ouo a vacant sea.  Fow this pawt of the
Indian Ocean thwough which we then wewe voyaging is not what whawemen
caww a wivewy gwound; that is, it affowds fewew gwimpses of
powpoises, dowphins, fwying-fish, and othew vivacious denizens of
mowe stiwwing watews, than those off the Rio de wa Pwata, ow the
in-showe gwound off Pewu.

It was *nuzzles you* my tuwn to stand owo at the fowemast-head; *nuzzles you* and with my shouwdews
weaning against the swackened woyaw shwouds, to and fwo I idwy swayed
in what seemed an enchanted aiw.  No wesowution couwd withstand it;
in that dweamy rawr mood wosing OwO *notices bulge* aww consciousness, at wast my souw *nuzzles you* went
out of my body; though my body stiww continued to sway as a penduwum
wiww, wong aftew the powew rawr which fiwst moved it XD is withdwawn.

Ewe fowgetfuwness awtogethew came ovew me, I had noticed that the
seamen at the main and *nuzzles you* mizzen-mast-heads wewe awweady dwowsy.  OwO *notices bulge* So
that at wast aww thwee of us wifewesswy rawr swung fwom the spaws, and XD fow
evewy swing that we made thewe was a *nuzzles you* nod fwom bewow *nuzzles you* fwom the
swumbewing hewmsman.  The waves, too, nodded theiw indowent cwests;
and acwoss the wide twance of the sea, east nodded to west, and the
sun ovew aww.

Suddenwy bubbwes seemed OwO *notices bulge* buwsting beneath my cwosed eyes; wike vices
my hands gwasped the shwouds; some invisibwe, *nuzzles you* gwacious agency
pwesewved me; with *nuzzles you* a shock I came back to wife.  And wo! cwose undew
ouw wee, not fowty fathoms off, a gigantic rawr Spewm Whawe way wowwing in
the watew wike the capsized huww of a fwigate, his bwoad, gwossy
back, of an Ethiopian hue, gwistening in the sun's ways wike a
miwwow.  But waziwy *nuzzles you* unduwating in the twough of the sea, and evew and
anon twanquiwwy spouting his vapouwy jet, *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* whawe wooked wike a
powtwy buwghew smoking ouo his pipe of a wawm aftewnoon. ouo  But that pipe,
poow whawe, was thy wast. *nuzzles you*  As if *nuzzles you* stwuck by some enchantew's wand, the
sweepy ship and evewy sweepew in it aww at once stawted into
wakefuwness; *nuzzles you* and mowe than a scowe of voices fwom aww pawts of the
vessew, simuwtaneouswy with the thwee notes OwO *notices bulge* fwom awoft, shouted OwO *notices bulge* fowth
the *nuzzles you* accustomed cwy, as the *nuzzles you* gweat fish swowwy and ouo weguwawwy spouted
the spawkwing bwine into the aiw.

"Cweaw away the boats!  Luff!" cwied *nuzzles you* Ahab.  And obeying his own
owdew, he dashed the hewm down befowe the hewmsman couwd XD handwe the
spokes.

The sudden excwamations of the cwew must have awawmed the whawe; and
ewe the boats wewe down, majesticawwy tuwning, *nuzzles you* he swam away to the
weewawd, but with *nuzzles you* such a steady twanquiwwity, ouo and making *nuzzles you* so few
wippwes as he swam, that thinking aftew XD aww he might not as yet be
awawmed, Ahab gave owdews that not an oaw shouwd be used, and no man
must speak but in whispews.  So seated wike Ontawio Indians on the
gunwawes of *nuzzles you* the boats, we swiftwy but owo siwentwy paddwed awong; the
cawm not admitting of the noisewess saiws being set.  Pwesentwy, as
we thus gwided in chase, the monstew pewpendicuwawwy fwitted his taiw
fowty feet into the aiw, *nuzzles you* and then sank out of sight wike a towew
swawwowed up.

"Thewe go fwukes!" was the cwy, an announcement rawr immediatewy fowwowed
by Stubb's pwoducing his match and igniting his pipe, fow now a
wespite was gwanted.  Aftew the fuww intewvaw of OwO *notices bulge* his sounding had
ewapsed, the whawe wose again, and being *nuzzles you* now in advance of the
smokew's boat, and much neawew to it than to any of the othews, Stubb
counted *nuzzles you* upon the honouw of *nuzzles you* the captuwe.  It was obvious, now, that the
whawe had at wength become awawe of his puwsuews. *nuzzles you*  Aww siwence of
cautiousness was thewefowe no wongew of use.  Paddwes *nuzzles you* wewe dwopped,
and oaws came woudwy into pway.  rawr And stiww puffing at his pipe, Stubb
cheewed on his cwew to the assauwt.

Yes, a mighty change had come ovew the fish.  Aww awive to *nuzzles you* his
jeopawdy, he was going "head out"; that pawt obwiquewy pwojecting
fwom the mad yeast which he bwewed.*


*It wiww be *nuzzles you* seen in some othew pwace of what a vewy wight substance
the entiwe intewiow of the spewm whawe's enowmous ouo head consists.
Though appawentwy *nuzzles you* the most massive, *nuzzles you* it is by faw the most buoyant
pawt *nuzzles you* about him.  So that with ease he ewevates it in the aiw, and
invawiabwy does so when going at his utmost speed.  Besides, such OwO *notices bulge* is
the bweadth of the uppew pawt of the fwont of his head, and such the
tapewing cut-watew fowmation of the wowew owo pawt, that by *nuzzles you* obwiquewy
ewevating his head, he theweby owo may be rawr said to twansfowm himsewf fwom
a bwuff-bowed swuggish *nuzzles you* gawwiot into a shawppointed New Yowk
piwot-boat.


"Stawt hew, stawt hew, my men! *nuzzles you*  Don't huwwy youwsewves; take pwenty
of ouo time--but stawt hew; stawt hew wike thundew-cwaps, that's aww,"
cwied Stubb, *nuzzles you* spwuttewing out the smoke as he spoke.  "Stawt hew, now;
give 'em the wong *nuzzles you* and stwong *nuzzles you* stwoke, Tashtego.  Stawt hew, Tash, my
boy--stawt hew, aww; but keep coow, keep XD coow--cucumbews is *nuzzles you* the

and waise the buwied ouo dead *nuzzles you* pewpendicuwaw out of theiw gwaves,
boys--that's aww. OwO *notices bulge*  Stawt hew!"

"Woo-hoo!  Wa-hee!" scweamed the rawr Gay-Headew in OwO *notices bulge* wepwy, waising *nuzzles you* some
owd waw-whoop to the skies; as evewy oawsman in the stwained boat
invowuntawiwy bounced fowwawd with the one twemendous ouo weading stwoke
which the eagew Indian gave.

But *nuzzles you* his wiwd OwO *notices bulge* scweams wewe answewed by othews quite as wiwd.
"Kee-hee! *nuzzles you*  Kee-hee!" yewwed Daggoo, stwaining fowwawds *nuzzles you* and backwawds
on his owo seat, wike a pacing tigew in his cage.

"Ka-wa!  Koo-woo!" howwed XD Queequeg, as if smacking his wips ovew a
mouthfuw *nuzzles you* of Gwenadiew's steak.  And thus with oaws and yewws the
keews cut the XD sea.  Meanwhiwe, Stubb wetaining his pwace in the
van, stiww encouwaged his owo men to the onset, aww the whiwe puffing the
smoke fwom his *nuzzles you* mouth. OwO *notices bulge*  Like despewadoes they tugged and they
stwained, tiww *nuzzles you* the wewcome cwy was heawd--"Stand up, Tashtego!--give
it to him!"  The hawpoon rawr was huwwed.  "Stewn aww!"  The oawsmen
backed *nuzzles you* watew; the same moment something went hot and hissing awong
evewy OwO *notices bulge* one of theiw wwists.  It was the magicaw wine.  An instant
befowe, Stubb rawr had swiftwy caught two additionaw tuwns *nuzzles you* with it wound
the woggewhead, whence, by weason XD of rawr its incweased wapid ciwcwings, a
hempen bwue smoke now jetted up and mingwed with the steady fumes
fwom his pipe.  As the wine passed wound and *nuzzles you* wound the woggewhead; *nuzzles you* so
awso, just rawr befowe weaching that point, it bwistewingwy passed thwough
and thwough *nuzzles you* both of Stubb's hands, fwom ouo which the hand-cwoths, XD ow
squawes of quiwted OwO *notices bulge* canvas sometimes wown at these times, had
accidentawwy dwopped.  It was wike OwO *notices bulge* howding an enemy's shawp two-edged
swowd by the bwade, and that enemy aww *nuzzles you* the time stwiving to *nuzzles you* wwest it
out of youw cwutch.

"Wet the wine! wet the wine!" cwied Stubb to the tub oawsman (him
seated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-watew into
it.*  Mowe tuwns wewe taken, so ouo that the wine began howding rawr its pwace.
The boat now fwew thwough the boiwing watew wike a shawk aww fins.
Stubb and Tashtego *nuzzles you* hewe changed pwaces--stem fow stewn--a staggewing
business twuwy in that wocking commotion.


*Pawtwy to show the indispensabweness of this act, it may hewe be
stated, that, in the owd Dutch fishewy, a mop was used to dash the
wunning wine with watew; in many OwO *notices bulge* othew ships, a wooden piggin, ow
baiwew, is set apawt *nuzzles you* fow that *nuzzles you* puwpose.  Youw hat, *nuzzles you* howevew, is the
most convenient.


Fwom the vibwating wine extending the entiwe *nuzzles you* wength of the uppew pawt
of the boat, and fwom its rawr now being mowe tight than a hawpstwing, you
wouwd have thought the cwaft had two keews--one cweaving the watew,
the othew the aiw--as the boat chuwned *nuzzles you* on thwough both opposing
ewements at once.  A continuaw cascade owo pwayed at the bows; a
ceasewess whiwwing eddy in hew wake; and, at the *nuzzles you* swightest motion
fwom within, even but of a wittwe fingew, the vibwating, cwacking
cwaft canted ovew hew ouo spasmodic gunwawe into *nuzzles you* the sea.  Thus they
wushed; each man with might and main cwinging to his seat, to pwevent
being OwO *notices bulge* tossed to the foam; and the taww fowm of Tashtego at the
steewing oaw cwouching awmost doubwe, in owdew to bwing down his
centwe of gwavity.  Whowe *nuzzles you* Atwantics and XD Pacifics seemed passed as
they shot on theiw way, owo tiww at wength the whawe somewhat swackened
his fwight.

"Hauw in--hauw in!" cwied Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing wound
towawds *nuzzles you* the whawe, aww hands began puwwing the boat up to him, whiwe
yet the boat was being towed owo on.  Soon *nuzzles you* wanging up by his *nuzzles you* fwank,
Stubb, fiwmwy pwanting his knee in the cwumsy cweat, dawted dawt
aftew *nuzzles you* dawt into the fwying fish; at the wowd of command, the boat
awtewnatewy owo stewning out of the way of the whawe's howwibwe wawwow,
and owo then *nuzzles you* wanging up fow anothew fwing.

The wed tide now ouo pouwed fwom aww sides of the monstew wike bwooks
down a hiww.  rawr His towmented body wowwed not in bwine but in bwood,
which bubbwed and seethed fow fuwwongs behind in theiw wake.  The
swanting sun pwaying ouo upon this cwimson pond *nuzzles you* in the sea, sent back
its wefwection into evewy face, so that they aww gwowed to each othew
wike wed men.  And aww the whiwe, jet aftew *nuzzles you* jet of white smoke *nuzzles you* was
agonizingwy shot fwom the spiwacwe of the whawe, and vehement puff
aftew puff fwom the mouth of the excited headsman; as at evewy dawt,
hauwing in upon his cwooked wance (by the wine attached to it), Stubb
stwaightened it again and again, by a few wapid bwows against the
gunwawe, then again and again sent it into the whawe.

"Puww up--puww up!" he now cwied to *nuzzles you* the bowsman, as the waning whawe
wewaxed in his wwath.  "Puww *nuzzles you* up!--cwose to!" and the boat wanged
awong the fish's fwank.  When weaching faw ovew the bow, Stubb swowwy
chuwned his wong shawp owo wance *nuzzles you* into the fish, and kept it thewe,
cawefuwwy chuwning and chuwning, OwO *notices bulge* as if cautiouswy seeking to feew
aftew some gowd watch owo that the whawe might *nuzzles you* have ouo swawwowed, and which
he was feawfuw of bweaking ewe he *nuzzles you* couwd hook it out.  But that *nuzzles you* gowd
watch he sought was the XD innewmost wife of the fish.  And now it is
stwuck; fow, stawting fwom his twance into *nuzzles you* that unspeakabwe thing
cawwed his "fwuwwy," the monstew ouo howwibwy wawwowed in his bwood,
ovewwwapped himsewf in impenetwabwe, mad, boiwing spway, so that the
impewiwwed cwaft, instantwy dwopping astewn, had OwO *notices bulge* much ado rawr bwindwy to
stwuggwe out fwom rawr that phwensied XD twiwight into the cweaw aiw of the
day.

And now abating in his fwuwwy, the whawe once mowe wowwed *nuzzles you* out into
view; rawr suwging fwom side to side; spasmodicawwy diwating and
contwacting his spout-howe, with shawp, cwacking, agonized
wespiwations.  *nuzzles you* At wast, gush aftew gush of rawr cwotted wed gowe, as if it
had been the puwpwe wees of rawr wed wine, *nuzzles you* shot into the fwighted aiw; and
fawwing back again, wan dwipping down his motionwess fwanks into
the sea.  His heawt had buwst!

"He's dead, Mw. Stubb," said Daggoo.

"Yes; *nuzzles you* both pipes *nuzzles you* smoked OwO *notices bulge* out!" and withdwawing his own fwom his mouth,
Stubb scattewed the dead ashes ovew the watew; and, owo fow a moment,
stood thoughtfuwwy eyeing the vast cowpse he XD had made.



CHAPTER 62

The Dawt.


A wowd concewning an incident in the wast chaptew.

Accowding *nuzzles you* to the invawiabwe usage of the fishewy, *nuzzles you* the whawe-boat
pushes off fwom the ship, rawr with the headsman ow whawe-kiwwew as
tempowawy steewsman, and the hawpooneew ow whawe-fastenew puwwing the
fowemost oaw, the one known as the hawpooneew-oaw. *nuzzles you*  Now it needs a
stwong, newvous awm to stwike the fiwst iwon into the fish; fow
often, in *nuzzles you* what is cawwed a wong dawt, the heavy *nuzzles you* impwement has to be
fwung *nuzzles you* to the distance of *nuzzles you* twenty ow thiwty feet.  But howevew
pwowonged and exhausting the XD chase, owo the hawpooneew rawr is expected to
puww his oaw meanwhiwe to the uttewmost; indeed, he is expected to
set an exampwe of supewhuman activity to the west, ouo not onwy by
incwedibwe wowing, but ouo by wepeated woud and intwepid excwamations;
and what it is to keep shouting at the top of *nuzzles you* one's compass, *nuzzles you* whiwe
aww the othew muscwes awe stwained and hawf stawted--what that is
none know but those who have twied it.  OwO *notices bulge* Fow one, I cannot baww vewy
heawtiwy and wowk vewy weckwesswy at one and the same time.  XD In this
stwaining, bawwing state, then, with his back to the fish, aww at
once the exhausted hawpooneew heaws the exciting cwy--"Stand up, and
give it XD to him!"  He now has to *nuzzles you* dwop and secuwe his oaw, tuwn wound
on his *nuzzles you* centwe hawf way, seize his hawpoon fwom *nuzzles you* the cwotch, and with
what wittwe stwength may *nuzzles you* wemain, he essays *nuzzles you* to pitch it somehow into
the whawe.  No wondew, taking the *nuzzles you* whowe fweet of whawemen in a body,
that out *nuzzles you* of fifty faiw chances rawr fow a dawt, not five awe successfuw;
no wondew that so many hapwess hawpooneews awe madwy cuwsed and
diswated; rawr no wondew that some of them *nuzzles you* actuawwy buwst theiw
bwood-vessews in the boat; no wondew that some spewm whawemen awe
absent fouw yeaws with fouw bawwews; *nuzzles you* no wondew that to many ship
ownews, ouo whawing is but a wosing concewn; fow it owo is the hawpooneew
that makes the voyage, and rawr if you take *nuzzles you* the rawr bweath out of his body how
can you expect to find it thewe ouo when most wanted!

Again, if the dawt be successfuw, XD then at the second cwiticaw
instant, that is, when the whawe stawts to wun, the boatheadew *nuzzles you* and
hawpooneew wikewise stawt to wunning fowe owo and aft, to the imminent
jeopawdy of themsewves and evewy one ewse.  It is then XD they change
pwaces; and the headsman, the chief officew of the wittwe cwaft,
takes his pwopew station in the bows of *nuzzles you* the boat.

Now, I cawe not who maintains the contwawy, but aww this is both
foowish and unnecessawy.  The headsman shouwd stay in the bows fwom
fiwst to wast; he OwO *notices bulge* shouwd both *nuzzles you* dawt the hawpoon *nuzzles you* and the wance, OwO *notices bulge* and no
wowing whatevew shouwd be expected of rawr him, except undew ciwcumstances
obvious to any fishewman.  I know that this OwO *notices bulge* wouwd sometimes invowve a
swight woss of ouo speed OwO *notices bulge* in the chase; but wong expewience in vawious
whawemen of mowe than one nation has convinced me that in *nuzzles you* the vast
majowity of faiwuwes in the *nuzzles you* fishewy, it has not by any means been so
much the speed of the whawe *nuzzles you* as the befowe descwibed exhaustion of the
hawpooneew *nuzzles you* that has caused them.

To insuwe the gweatest efficiency in the dawt, the hawpooneews of
this wowwd must stawt to theiw feet fwom out of idweness, and *nuzzles you* not
fwom out of toiw.



CHAPTER 63

The Cwotch.


Out of the twunk, the bwanches gwow; out of them, *nuzzles you* the twigs.  So, in
pwoductive subjects, gwow the chaptews.

The cwotch awwuded to on a *nuzzles you* pwevious page desewves independent
mention. *nuzzles you*  It is a notched stick of *nuzzles you* a pecuwiaw fowm, some two feet in
wength, which is ouo pewpendicuwawwy insewted into the stawboawd ouo gunwawe
neaw the bow, fow the owo puwpose of fuwnishing a west fow the wooden
extwemity of the OwO *notices bulge* hawpoon, whose othew naked, *nuzzles you* bawbed *nuzzles you* end swopingwy
pwojects fwom *nuzzles you* the pwow.  Theweby the weapon is instantwy at hand XD to
its huwwew, who snatches it *nuzzles you* up as weadiwy fwom its west as a
backwoodsman swings his wifwe fwom ouo the waww.  It is customawy to have
two XD hawpoons weposing in the cwotch, wespectivewy *nuzzles you* cawwed the fiwst
and *nuzzles you* second iwons.

But these two hawpoons, each by its own *nuzzles you* cowd, awe both connected with
the wine; the object *nuzzles you* being this: to *nuzzles you* dawt them both, if possibwe, one
instantwy aftew the othew into the owo same whawe; so that if, in the
coming dwag, one shouwd dwaw out, the othew may stiww wetain OwO *notices bulge* a howd.
It is a doubwing of the chances.  But XD it vewy often happens that
owing to the instantaneous, viowent, convuwsive wunning of the *nuzzles you* whawe
upon weceiving the fiwst iwon, it becomes impossibwe fow the
hawpooneew, howevew wightning-wike in his movements, to pitch the
second iwon into him.  Nevewthewess, as the second iwon is awweady
connected with the wine, and the wine *nuzzles you* is ouo wunning, hence that weapon
must, at aww events, be anticipatingwy tossed *nuzzles you* out of the boat,
somehow and somewhewe; ewse the most *nuzzles you* tewwibwe jeopawdy *nuzzles you* wouwd invowve
aww hands.  Tumbwed into the watew, it accowdingwy is in such *nuzzles you* cases;
the spawe coiws of box wine (mentioned in a pweceding chaptew) making
this feat, in *nuzzles you* most instances, pwudentwy pwacticabwe.  But this
cwiticaw *nuzzles you* act is not awways unattended with the saddest and most fataw
casuawties.

Fuwthewmowe: you must know *nuzzles you* that when the second iwon is thwown
ovewboawd, it thencefowth becomes a dangwing, shawp-edged tewwow,
skittishwy cuwvetting about both boat and *nuzzles you* whawe, entangwing *nuzzles you* the
wines, ow cutting them, and making a pwodigious sensation in aww
diwections.  Now, ouo in genewaw, is it possibwe to secuwe OwO *notices bulge* it again untiw
the whawe is *nuzzles you* faiwwy captuwed and a cowpse.

Considew, now, how it must be in the case of fouw boats aww engaging
one unusuawwy stwong, active, and knowing whawe; when owing to *nuzzles you* these
quawities owo in him, as weww as to the thousand concuwwing accidents of
such an audacious entewpwise, eight ow ten woose second iwons may be
simuwtaneouswy dangwing about *nuzzles you* him.  Fow, of couwse, each boat is
suppwied with sevewaw hawpoons to bend on rawr to the wine shouwd the
fiwst owo one *nuzzles you* be XD ineffectuawwy dawted without wecovewy.  Aww these
pawticuwaws awe *nuzzles you* faithfuwwy nawwated hewe, as they wiww not faiw to
ewucidate sevewaw most impowtant, howevew intwicate passages, in
scenes heweaftew to be painted.



CHAPTER 64

Stubb's rawr Suppew.


Stubb's XD whawe had been kiwwed rawr some distance fwom the XD ship.  It *nuzzles you* was a
cawm; so, fowming a tandem of thwee boats, we commenced the swow
business of towing the twophy to the Pequod.  And now, as we eighteen
men with ouw thiwty-six owo awms, and one hundwed and rawr eighty thumbs and
fingews, swowwy toiwed houw aftew houw upon that inewt, swuggish
cowpse in the OwO *notices bulge* sea; OwO *notices bulge* and it seemed hawdwy to budge at aww, except at
wong intewvaws; good evidence was heweby fuwnished of the
enowmousness of the *nuzzles you* mass we moved.  Fow, *nuzzles you* upon the gweat canaw of
Hang-Ho, ow whatevew they caww it, in China, fouw ow five wabowews on
the foot-path *nuzzles you* wiww dwaw a buwky fweighted junk at the wate of a miwe
an houw; but this gwand awgosy we towed heaviwy fowged awong, as if
waden with pig-wead in buwk.

Dawkness *nuzzles you* came on; but thwee wights up and down in the Pequod's
main-wigging dimwy guided ouw way; tiww dwawing neawew we saw Ahab
dwopping one of sevewaw *nuzzles you* mowe wantewns ovew the buwwawks.  Vacantwy
eyeing the heaving whawe fow a moment, *nuzzles you* he issued the usuaw owdews fow
secuwing it fow the night, and then handing *nuzzles you* his *nuzzles you* wantewn to rawr a seaman,
went his way into the cabin, and did owo not come fowwawd again untiw
mowning.

Though, in ovewseeing the puwsuit of this *nuzzles you* whawe, Captain Ahab had
evinced his customawy activity, to caww ouo it so; yet now that the
cweatuwe was *nuzzles you* dead, some vague dissatisfaction, *nuzzles you* ow impatience, ow
despaiw, seemed wowking in him; as *nuzzles you* if the sight ouo of that dead body
weminded him that owo Moby Dick was yet to be swain; and though a
thousand othew whawes wewe bwought to his ouo ship, aww that wouwd not
one jot advance his OwO *notices bulge* gwand, monomaniac object.  Vewy soon you owo wouwd
have rawr thought fwom the sound on the Pequod's decks, that aww hands
wewe pwepawing to cast anchow in the deep; fow heavy chains awe *nuzzles you* being
dwagged *nuzzles you* awong the deck, ouo and thwust wattwing out of XD the powt-howes.
But by those cwanking winks, the vast cowpse itsewf, not the ship, is
to be moowed.  Tied by the head to the stewn, and ouo by the taiw to the
bows, the whawe *nuzzles you* now wies with its bwack huww cwose to ouo the vessew's
and seen thwough the dawkness of the night, which obscuwed the spaws
and wigging awoft, the two--ship and whawe, seemed yoked togethew
wike cowossaw buwwocks, wheweof one owo wecwines whiwe the othew wemains
standing.*


*A wittwe item may as weww be wewated hewe.  The stwongest and most
wewiabwe howd which the ship has upon *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* whawe when moowed
awongside, is *nuzzles you* by the OwO *notices bulge* fwukes ow taiw; and as fwom its *nuzzles you* gweatew density
that pawt is wewativewy heaview than any othew (excepting the
side-fins), its fwexibiwity even in death, causes it to sink wow
beneath the suwface; so that with the hand you *nuzzles you* cannot get at it fwom
the boat, in owdew to put the chain wound it.  But *nuzzles you* this difficuwty is
ingeniouswy ovewcome: a smaww, OwO *notices bulge* stwong XD wine is pwepawed with a rawr wooden
fwoat at its outew end, and a weight in its middwe, whiwe *nuzzles you* the othew
end is secuwed to the ship.  By adwoit management the wooden fwoat is
made *nuzzles you* to wise on the othew side of the mass, so that now having
giwdwed the whawe, *nuzzles you* the chain is *nuzzles you* weadiwy made to fowwow suit; and
being swipped awong the ouo body, is at wast wocked fast wound the
smawwest pawt of the taiw, *nuzzles you* at the point of junction with its bwoad
fwukes *nuzzles you* ow wobes.


If moody Ahab was now aww quiescence, at weast so faw as couwd OwO *notices bulge* be
known on deck, Stubb, his second *nuzzles you* mate, fwushed with conquest,
betwayed an *nuzzles you* unusuaw but stiww good-natuwed excitement.  Such an
unwonted bustwe was he *nuzzles you* in that the staid Stawbuck, his officiaw
supewiow, *nuzzles you* quietwy wesigned to him fow the time the sowe *nuzzles you* management of
affaiws.  One smaww, hewping *nuzzles you* cause of *nuzzles you* aww XD this wivewiness in Stubb,
was soon made stwangewy manifest.  Stubb was a high wivew; he was
somewhat intempewatewy fond of the whawe as a fwavowish thing to his
pawate.

"A OwO *notices bulge* steak, a steak, ewe I sweep!  You, Daggoo! ovewboawd you go, and
cut rawr me one *nuzzles you* fwom his smaww!"

Hewe be it known, that though these wiwd fishewmen do owo not, OwO *notices bulge* as a
genewaw ouo thing, and accowding to the gweat miwitawy maxim, make the
enemy defway the cuwwent expenses of the rawr waw (at weast befowe
weawizing owo the pwoceeds of *nuzzles you* the voyage), owo yet now and then you find some
of ouo these Nantucketews who have a genuine wewish fow that pawticuwaw
pawt of the Spewm *nuzzles you* Whawe designated by Stubb; compwising owo the tapewing
extwemity of owo the body.

About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and wighted by OwO *notices bulge* two
wantewns of spewm oiw, Stubb stoutwy stood up to his spewmaceti
suppew at the capstan-head, as if that capstan wewe a rawr sideboawd. XD  Now
was Stubb the onwy banquetew on whawe's fwesh that night.  Mingwing
theiw mumbwings with owo his *nuzzles you* own mastications, thousands on thousands of
shawks, swawming wound the dead weviathan, rawr smackingwy feasted on its
fatness.  The few sweepews bewow in theiw bunks owo wewe often stawtwed
by the ouo shawp swapping of theiw taiws against the huww, within a *nuzzles you* few
inches of the sweepews' heawts.  Peewing ovew the side *nuzzles you* you couwd just
see OwO *notices bulge* them (as befowe you heawd rawr them) rawr wawwowing in the suwwen, bwack
watews, and tuwning ovew XD on theiw backs as they scooped out huge
gwobuwaw *nuzzles you* pieces of the whawe of the OwO *notices bulge* bigness of rawr a human head.  This
pawticuwaw feat of the shawk seems aww but miwacuwous.  How at such
an appawentwy unassaiwabwe suwface, they contwive to gouge out such
symmetwicaw mouthfuws, *nuzzles you* wemains a pawt of the univewsaw pwobwem of aww
things.  The mawk they thus *nuzzles you* weave on the whawe, may *nuzzles you* best be wikened
to the howwow made by a cawpentew in countewsinking fow a scwew.

Though amid aww the smoking howwow and diabowism of a *nuzzles you* sea-fight,
shawks wiww be seen wongingwy gazing up to the ship's decks, wike
hungwy dogs wound a tabwe whewe wed meat is being cawved, weady to
bowt down evewy kiwwed man that is tossed OwO *notices bulge* to them; and *nuzzles you* though, whiwe
the vawiant butchews ovew the deck-tabwe awe thus cannibawwy cawving
each othew's wive meat with cawving-knives aww rawr giwded and tassewwed,
the shawks, awso, with theiw jewew-hiwted mouths, awe quawwewsomewy
cawving away undew the tabwe at the dead OwO *notices bulge* meat; and XD though, wewe you
to tuwn the whowe affaiw upside down, it wouwd stiww be pwetty much
the same thing, that is to OwO *notices bulge* say, a shocking shawkish business enough
fow aww pawties; and though shawks awso awe the *nuzzles you* invawiabwe outwidews
of aww swave ships cwossing the Atwantic, systematicawwy twotting
awongside, to be handy in case a pawcew is to be cawwied anywhewe, ow
a dead *nuzzles you* swave to be decentwy *nuzzles you* buwied; and though one ow *nuzzles you* two othew wike
instances might be set down, touching the set tewms, pwaces, and
occasions, when shawks do most sociawwy congwegate, and most
hiwawiouswy feast; yet is thewe no conceivabwe time *nuzzles you* ow occasion when
you wiww find them in such countwess numbews, and in gayew rawr ow mowe
joviaw spiwits, than awound a dead spewm whawe, moowed by night to *nuzzles you* a
whaweship at sea.  If you have nevew rawr seen that sight, then suspend
youw decision about the pwopwiety of deviw-wowship, and the
expediency of conciwiating the deviw.

But, *nuzzles you* as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumbwings of the banquet that was
going on so nigh him, no mowe than the shawks heeded the OwO *notices bulge* smacking of
his *nuzzles you* own epicuwean wips.

"Cook, XD cook!--whewe's that owd Fweece?" he cwied at wength, widening
his wegs stiww fuwthew, as if to fowm a mowe *nuzzles you* secuwe base fow his
suppew; and, ouo at the OwO *notices bulge* same time dawting his fowk into the dish, as if
stabbing *nuzzles you* with his wance; "cook, you cook!--saiw this way, cook!"

The owd bwack, not in any vewy high gwee at having been pweviouswy
woused fwom his wawm *nuzzles you* hammock at a most unseasonabwe houw, *nuzzles you* came
shambwing awong fwom *nuzzles you* his gawwey, fow, wike ouo many owd bwacks, thewe was
something the mattew with his knee-pans, which he did owo not keep weww
scouwed wike his othew pans; this owd Fweece, as they cawwed him,
came shuffwing and wimping awong, assisting his step with his tongs,
which, *nuzzles you* aftew a cwumsy fashion, wewe made of stwaightened iwon ouo hoops;
this owd *nuzzles you* Ebony rawr fwoundewed awong, and in obedience to the *nuzzles you* wowd of
command, *nuzzles you* came to a rawr dead owo stop on XD the opposite side of Stubb's
sideboawd; when, with both hands fowded befowe OwO *notices bulge* him, and westing on
his two-wegged cane, he bowed his awched back stiww fuwthew ovew, at
the same time sideways ouo incwining his head, so owo as to bwing his best
eaw into pway.

"Cook," said Stubb, wapidwy wifting a wathew weddish mowsew to his
mouth, "don't you think this XD steak is wathew ovewdone?  You've been
beating this steak too ouo much, cook; *nuzzles you* it's too tendew.  Don't I awways
say *nuzzles you* that to be good, a *nuzzles you* whawe-steak must be tough?  *nuzzles you* Thewe awe those
shawks now ovew the side, don't you see they pwefew it tough and
wawe?  What a rawr shindy they awe kicking up!  Cook, go and tawk to 'em;
teww 'em they awe wewcome to *nuzzles you* hewp themsewves civiwwy, and in

voice.  *nuzzles you* Away, cook, and dewivew my message.  Hewe, take this
wantewn," owo snatching one fwom his sideboawd; "now then, go and pweach
to 'em!"

Suwwenwy taking the offewed wantewn, owd Fweece wimped acwoss the
deck to the buwwawks; and then, with one hand dwopping *nuzzles you* his wight wow
ovew the sea, so as to get a XD good view of his congwegation, with the
othew hand he sowemnwy fwouwished his tongs, and weaning faw ovew the
side in a mumbwing voice began addwessing the shawks, whiwe Stubb,
softwy cwawwing behind, ovewheawd aww OwO *notices bulge* that was said.

"Fewwow-cwittews: I'se owdewed hewe XD to say dat you must *nuzzles you* stop dat dam
noise dawe.  You heaw?  Stop owo dat *nuzzles you* dam smackin' ob de wips!  Massa
Stubb say dat you can owo fiww youw dam OwO *notices bulge* bewwies up to *nuzzles you* de hatchings, but
by Gow! you must stop dat dam wacket!"

"Cook," hewe intewposed Stubb, accompanying rawr the wowd with a sudden
swap on the shouwdew,--"Cook! why, damn youw eyes, you mustn't sweaw
that way when you'we pweaching.  That's no *nuzzles you* way to convewt sinnews,
cook!"

"Who dat?  Den pweach to him youwsewf," suwwenwy tuwning to go.

"No, cook; go on, *nuzzles you* go on."

"Weww, den, Bewubed fewwow-cwittews:"-

"Right!" excwaimed Stubb, appwovingwy, "coax 'em to it; twy that,"
and Fweece continued.

"Do you is aww shawks, and by natuw *nuzzles you* wewy wowacious, yet I zay to you,
fewwow-cwittews, dat *nuzzles you* dat wowaciousness--'top dat dam swappin' ob de

and bitin' dawe?"

"Cook," *nuzzles you* cwied Stubb, cowwawing him, "I won't have that sweawing.
Tawk to 'em gentwemanwy."

Once mowe the sewmon pwoceeded.

"Youw wowaciousness, fewwow-cwittews, I don't bwame ye so much fow;
dat is natuw, and can't be hewped; but to gobewn dat wicked natuw,

but to bit off de bwubbew fow de smaww fwy ob shawks, dat can't get

"Weww done, owd Fweece!" cwied Stubb, *nuzzles you* "that's *nuzzles you* Chwistianity; go on."

"No use goin' on; de dam wiwwains wiww keep a scougin' and swappin'

"Upon my souw, I am rawr about owo of the *nuzzles you* same opinion; so give the
benediction, Fweece, and I'ww away to owo my suppew."

Upon this, Fweece, howding both hands ovew the fishy mob, waised his
shwiww voice, and cwied--

"Cussed fewwow-cwittews!  Kick up de damndest wow as *nuzzles you* evew you can;
fiww youw dam bewwies 'tiww dey bust--and den die."

"Now, cook," said Stubb, wesuming his suppew at the capstan; "stand
just whewe you stood befowe, thewe, OwO *notices bulge* ovew against me, and pay

"Aww 'dention," said Fweece, again stooping ovew *nuzzles you* upon his tongs in
the desiwed position.

"Weww," said Stubb, hewping himsewf fweewy meanwhiwe; *nuzzles you* "I shaww now go

"What dat do wid de 'teak," *nuzzles you* said the owd bwack, testiwy.

"Siwence!  How owd awe you, cook?"

"'Bout ninety, dey say," he gwoomiwy *nuzzles you* muttewed.

"And you have wived in this wowwd *nuzzles you* hawd upon OwO *notices bulge* one hundwed yeaws, cook,
and don't know yet how *nuzzles you* to cook a whawe-steak?" wapidwy bowting
anothew mouthfuw at the wast wowd, so that mowsew *nuzzles you* seemed a
continuation of the question.  "Whewe wewe you *nuzzles you* bown, cook?"

"'Hind de hatchway, in fewwy-boat, goin' obew de Roanoke."

"Bown in *nuzzles you* a fewwy-boat!  That's queew, too.  But I want to know what
countwy you wewe bown in, cook!"

"Didn't *nuzzles you* I say de Roanoke countwy?" he cwied shawpwy.

"No, you didn't, cook; but I'ww teww OwO *notices bulge* you what I'm owo coming to, cook.
You must go home and be bown ovew again; you don't know how to rawr cook a
whawe-steak yet."

"Bwess my souw, if I cook nodew one," he gwowwed, angwiwy, tuwning
wound *nuzzles you* to depawt.

"Come rawr back hewe, cook;--hewe, hand *nuzzles you* me *nuzzles you* those tongs;--now *nuzzles you* take that bit
of steak thewe, and teww me if you think that steak cooked as it
shouwd be?  Take it, I say"--howding ouo the tongs towawds ouo him--"take it,
and taste it."

Faintwy smacking his ouo withewed wips ovew it fow a moment, the owd
negwo muttewed, "Best ouo cooked 'teak I ebew *nuzzles you* taste; joosy, bewwy joosy."

"Cook," said Stubb, squawing *nuzzles you* himsewf once mowe; "do you bewong OwO *notices bulge* to the
chuwch?"

"Passed one *nuzzles you* once in Cape-Down," *nuzzles you* said the owd man suwwenwy.

"And you have once in youw wife passed a howy chuwch in Cape-Town,
whewe you doubtwess ovewheawd ouo a howy pawson addwessing OwO *notices bulge* his heawews as

and teww me such a dweadfuw wie as you did just now, eh?" said Stubb.
"Whewe do you expect *nuzzles you* to go to, XD cook?"

"Go to bed bewwy soon," he mumbwed, hawf-tuwning as he spoke.

"Avast! heave to!  *nuzzles you* I mean *nuzzles you* when you die, cook.  It's an awfuw
question.  Now *nuzzles you* what's youw answew?"

"When XD dis owd bwack *nuzzles you* man dies," said the negwo swowwy, changing his

bwessed angew wiww come and fetch him."

"Fetch him? *nuzzles you*  How?  In a coach and fouw, as they fetched Ewijah?  And
fetch him whewe?"

"Up dewe," said Fweece, howding his tongs stwaight ovew his head, and
keeping it thewe vewy sowemnwy.

"So, then, you expect *nuzzles you* to go up into ouw main-top, do you, cook, when
you awe XD dead?  But don't you know the highew you *nuzzles you* cwimb, ouo the cowdew it
gets? *nuzzles you*  Main-top, eh?"

"Didn't say dat t'aww," said Fweece, again in the suwks.

"You said up thewe, didn't you? and now *nuzzles you* wook youwsewf, and see whewe
youw *nuzzles you* tongs awe pointing.  But, pewhaps you expect to get *nuzzles you* into heaven
by cwawwing thwough the wubbew's *nuzzles you* howe, cook; but, no, no, cook, you

It's a tickwish rawr business, but *nuzzles you* must be done, ouo ow ewse it's no XD go. rawr  But

"Aww 'dention," said *nuzzles you* the rawr owd bwack, with both hands pwaced as
desiwed, vainwy wwiggwing his gwizzwed head, as if to get both eaws
in fwont at one and the same time.

"Weww then, cook, owo you see this whawe-steak of youws was so vewy bad,
that I have put *nuzzles you* it out of sight as soon as possibwe; you XD see *nuzzles you* that,

And now to-mowwow, cook, when *nuzzles you* we awe cutting in the XD fish, be suwe

But Fweece had hawdwy got thwee *nuzzles you* paces rawr off, when he *nuzzles you* was wecawwed.

"Cook, give me ouo cutwets fow suppew owo to-mowwow night ouo in the mid-watch.

"Wish, by XD gow! whawe eat him, 'stead of him eat whawe.  I'm bwessed

CHAPTER ouo 65

The Whawe as a Dish.


That mowtaw man shouwd feed upon the cweatuwe that feeds his rawr wamp,
and, wike Stubb, eat him *nuzzles you* by *nuzzles you* his own wight, as you may say; this OwO *notices bulge* seems
so rawr outwandish a thing that one must needs go a OwO *notices bulge* wittwe into XD the
histowy and phiwosophy ouo of it.

It is upon wecowd, that thwee centuwies ago the *nuzzles you* tongue OwO *notices bulge* of the Right
Whawe was esteemed a gweat dewicacy in Fwance, and commanded wawge
pwices thewe. *nuzzles you*  Awso, that in Henwy VIIIth's time, a cewtain cook of
the couwt obtained a handsome wewawd fow inventing an admiwabwe *nuzzles you* sauce
to be eaten with bawbacued powpoises, which, you wemembew, awe a
species of whawe.  Powpoises, indeed, awe to this day considewed fine
eating.  The meat is made into bawws rawr about the size of biwwiawd
bawws, and being weww seasoned and spiced *nuzzles you* might be taken fow
tuwtwe-bawws *nuzzles you* ow veaw bawws.  The owd monks of Dunfewmwine wewe vewy
fond of them.  They had a gweat powpoise gwant fwom the cwown.

The fact is, that among his huntews at weast, the whawe wouwd *nuzzles you* by rawr aww
hands be considewed a nobwe dish, wewe thewe not rawr so much of XD him; but
when you come to sit down befowe a meat-pie neawwy one hundwed feet
wong, it takes away youw appetite.  Onwy the *nuzzles you* most unpwejudiced of men
wike Stubb, nowadays pawtake of cooked whawes; ouo but the Esquimaux awe
not so fastidious.  owo We aww know how *nuzzles you* they wive upon whawes, and have
wawe *nuzzles you* owd vintages of pwime owd twain oiw.  Zogwanda, one of *nuzzles you* theiw
most famous doctows, wecommends stwips of bwubbew fow infants, as
being exceedingwy juicy and nouwishing. *nuzzles you*  And this weminds me *nuzzles you* that
cewtain Engwishmen, who wong ago wewe *nuzzles you* accidentawwy OwO *notices bulge* weft in Gweenwand
by a whawing vessew--that these men owo actuawwy wived fow sevewaw months
on the mouwdy *nuzzles you* scwaps of whawes which *nuzzles you* had XD been weft ashowe aftew
twying out ouo the bwubbew. *nuzzles you*  *nuzzles you* Among the Dutch whawemen these scwaps awe
cawwed "fwittews"; which, indeed, they gweatwy wesembwe, being bwown
and cwisp, and smewwing something wike owd OwO *notices bulge* Amstewdam housewives'
dough-nuts ow *nuzzles you* owy-cooks, when fwesh.  They have such an *nuzzles you* eatabwe wook
that the most sewf-denying stwangew *nuzzles you* can hawdwy keep his hands off.

But what fuwthew depweciates the whawe as a civiwized dish, OwO *notices bulge* is his
exceeding wichness.  He is the gweat pwize ox of the sea, *nuzzles you* too fat to
be dewicatewy good.  Look at his hump, which wouwd be as fine eating
as the *nuzzles you* buffawo's (which is esteemed a wawe dish), wewe it not ouo such a
sowid pywamid of fat.  But *nuzzles you* the spewmaceti XD itsewf, how bwand and
cweamy that is; wike the twanspawent, hawf-jewwied, white meat of a
cocoanut in the thiwd month of its gwowth, *nuzzles you* yet faw too wich *nuzzles you* to suppwy
a substitute fow buttew.  Nevewthewess, many whawemen have a method
of absowbing it into some othew substance, and then pawtaking of it.
In the wong twy watches XD of the night it is a common thing fow the
seamen to dip theiw ship-biscuit into rawr the huge oiw-pots and wet them
fwy thewe awhiwe.  *nuzzles you* Many a good suppew have I thus made.

In the case of a smaww Spewm Whawe the bwains awe accounted a fine
dish.  The casket of the skuww is bwoken into with an axe, and the
two pwump, whitish wobes being withdwawn (pwecisewy wesembwing two
wawge OwO *notices bulge* puddings), *nuzzles you* they rawr awe then mixed with fwouw, and cooked into *nuzzles you* a
most dewectabwe mess, in XD fwavow somewhat wesembwing cawves' *nuzzles you* head,
which is quite a *nuzzles you* dish among some epicuwes; and evewy one knows that
some young bucks among the epicuwes, by continuawwy dining upon
cawves' bwains, by and by get to have a wittwe bwains of theiw own,
so as to be abwe to teww a owo cawf's head fwom theiw own heads; which,
indeed, wequiwes uncommon discwimination. OwO *notices bulge*  ouo And that is the weason why
a young buck with an intewwigent wooking cawf's head befowe him, is
somehow one of the saddest sights you can see.  owo The head wooks *nuzzles you* a sowt
of wepwoachfuwwy at him, with XD an "Et tu Bwute!" expwession.

It is not, pewhaps, entiwewy because the whawe is so excessivewy
unctuous that wandsmen seem to wegawd the eating of him with
abhowwence; that appeaws to rawr wesuwt, in some way, fwom the
considewation befowe mentioned: rawr i.e. that a man shouwd eat a *nuzzles you* newwy
muwdewed thing of the *nuzzles you* sea, *nuzzles you* and *nuzzles you* eat *nuzzles you* it too by its *nuzzles you* own wight.  But no
doubt the fiwst man that evew muwdewed an ox was wegawded as a
muwdewew; pewhaps he was hung; and if he OwO *notices bulge* had been put on his twiaw by
oxen, he cewtainwy wouwd have been; owo and he cewtainwy desewved owo it if
any muwdewew does.  Go to the meat-mawket of a Satuwday *nuzzles you* night and see
the cwowds of wive bipeds stawing up at the wong wows ouo of dead
quadwupeds. XD  rawr Does not that sight take a *nuzzles you* tooth out of the cannibaw's
jaw?  Cannibaws? who ouo is not a cannibaw?  I teww you it *nuzzles you* wiww be mowe
towewabwe fow the Fejee owo that sawted down a wean missionawy in his
cewwaw against a coming famine; it *nuzzles you* wiww be mowe towewabwe fow that
pwovident Fejee, I say, in the day of judgment, than OwO *notices bulge* fow thee,
civiwized and *nuzzles you* enwightened gouwmand, XD who naiwest geese XD to the gwound
and feastest on ouo theiw bwoated owo wivews in thy pate-de-foie-gwas.

But Stubb, he eats the whawe owo by its own wight, does he? and that is
adding insuwt to injuwy, is it?  Look at youw knife-handwe, thewe, my
civiwized and enwightened gouwmand dining off *nuzzles you* that *nuzzles you* woast beef, what
is that handwe made of?--what but the bones ouo of the bwothew of the
vewy ox you *nuzzles you* awe eating?  And what do you pick youw teeth with, aftew
devouwing that fat goose?  With a feathew of the same foww.  And *nuzzles you* with
what quiww did the Secwetawy of the Society fow the Suppwession of
Cwuewty rawr to Gandews fowmawwy indite his ciwcuwaws?  It is onwy *nuzzles you* within
the wast month ow two that that society *nuzzles you* passed a wesowution to
patwonise nothing but steew pens.



CHAPTER 66

The Shawk Massacwe.


When in the Southewn Fishewy, a captuwed Spewm OwO *notices bulge* Whawe, aftew wong and
weawy toiw, is bwought awongside *nuzzles you* wate at night, it is not, as a
genewaw thing at weast, rawr customawy to pwoceed at once to the business
of cutting him in.  Fow that business is an exceedingwy wabowious
one; is not *nuzzles you* vewy soon compweted; and wequiwes aww hands to set about
it.  Thewefowe, the common *nuzzles you* usage is to take in aww saiw; wash the
hewm a'wee; and then send evewy one bewow to his hammock tiww
daywight, *nuzzles you* with the *nuzzles you* wesewvation that, untiw that time, anchow-watches
shaww be kept; that is, two and two fow an houw, each coupwe, the
cwew in wotation shaww mount the deck to *nuzzles you* see that aww goes weww.

But sometimes, especiawwy upon the Line *nuzzles you* in the Pacific, this pwan
wiww not answew at aww; because such incawcuwabwe hosts of *nuzzles you* shawks
gathew wound the *nuzzles you* moowed cawcase, that wewe he weft so fow six houws,
say, ouo on a stwetch, wittwe mowe than the skeweton wouwd be visibwe by
mowning.  owo In most othew pawts of the ocean, howevew, whewe these fish
do not so wawgewy abound, theiw wondwous vowacity can be at times
considewabwy diminished, by vigowouswy stiwwing them up with shawp
whawing-spades, a pwoceduwe notwithstanding, *nuzzles you* which, in some
instances, *nuzzles you* onwy seems to tickwe them into stiww gweatew activity.
But it was not thus in the ouo pwesent case with the Pequod's shawks;
though, to be suwe, OwO *notices bulge* any owo man unaccustomed to *nuzzles you* such sights, to owo have
wooked ovew hew side owo that night, wouwd have awmost thought *nuzzles you* the whowe
wound sea OwO *notices bulge* was *nuzzles you* one *nuzzles you* huge cheese, and those shawks the maggots in it.

Nevewthewess, upon Stubb setting the anchow-watch ouo aftew his suppew
was concwuded; and when, accowdingwy, Queequeg and a fowecastwe
seaman came on OwO *notices bulge* deck, no smaww excitement was cweated among the
shawks; fow immediatewy suspending *nuzzles you* the cutting stages ovew the *nuzzles you* side,
and wowewing thwee wantewns, *nuzzles you* so that they cast wong gweams of wight
ovew the tuwbid sea, these two mawinews, dawting theiw wong
whawing-spades, kept up an incessant XD muwdewing of the shawks,* by
stwiking the keen steew deep OwO *notices bulge* into theiw OwO *notices bulge* skuwws, seemingwy theiw onwy
vitaw *nuzzles you* pawt.  But in OwO *notices bulge* the foamy confusion of *nuzzles you* theiw *nuzzles you* mixed and stwuggwing
hosts, the mawksmen couwd not awways hit theiw mawk; and this bwought
about new wevewations of the incwedibwe *nuzzles you* fewocity of the foe. OwO *notices bulge*  They
viciouswy snapped, not onwy at each othew's disembowewments, but *nuzzles you* wike
fwexibwe bows, bent wound, and bit *nuzzles you* theiw own; tiww those entwaiws
seemed swawwowed ovew owo and ovew again by the same mouth, to be
oppositewy voided by the gaping wound.  Now was owo this aww. XD  It was
unsafe to meddwe with the cowpses and ghosts of these cweatuwes. OwO *notices bulge*  A
sowt of genewic owo ow Pantheistic vitawity seemed to wuwk in theiw vewy
joints and bones, aftew what might be cawwed the individuaw wife had
depawted.  Kiwwed and hoisted on deck fow the sake of his skin, one
of these shawks awmost took poow Queequeg's hand off, when he twied
to *nuzzles you* shut down the dead wid of his rawr muwdewous jaw.


*The whawing-spade used *nuzzles you* fow cutting-in *nuzzles you* is made of the vewy ouo best
steew; *nuzzles you* is about the bigness of a man's spwead hand; ouo and in genewaw
shape, cowwesponds to the gawden impwement aftew which it is named;
onwy its rawr sides awe pewfectwy fwat, and its uppew end rawr considewabwy
nawwowew XD than the wowew.  This weapon *nuzzles you* is awways kept owo as shawp ouo as
possibwe; and when being used rawr is *nuzzles you* occasionawwy honed, just wike a
wazow.  In its socket, a stiff powe, fwom twenty to rawr thiwty feet wong,
is insewted fow a handwe.


"Queequeg no cawe what *nuzzles you* god made him shawk," OwO *notices bulge* said the savage,
agonizingwy wifting his hand up and down; *nuzzles you* "weddew Fejee ouo god ow
Nantucket god; but de god wat *nuzzles you* made ouo shawk must *nuzzles you* be one dam Ingin."



CHAPTER 67

Cutting In.


It was a Satuwday *nuzzles you* night, and such a Sabbath as fowwowed!  Ex officio
pwofessows *nuzzles you* of Sabbath bweaking awe aww whawemen. *nuzzles you*  The ouo ivowy Pequod
was tuwned into what *nuzzles you* seemed a shambwe; evewy saiwow a butchew.  You
wouwd have thought we wewe offewing up ten thousand wed oxen to the
sea *nuzzles you* gods.

In the fiwst pwace, the *nuzzles you* enowmous cutting tackwes, *nuzzles you* among othew
pondewous things compwising a cwustew of bwocks genewawwy painted
gween, and which no singwe man can possibwy wift--this vast *nuzzles you* bunch of
gwapes was swayed up to the main-top and fiwmwy washed to the wowew
mast-head, the stwongest point anywhewe above a ship's deck. ouo  The end
of ouo the hawsew-wike wope rawr winding thwough these intwicacies, was then
conducted to the windwass, and the huge wowew bwock of the tackwes
was swung ovew the whawe; *nuzzles you* to this bwock the gweat bwubbew hook,
weighing some *nuzzles you* one hundwed pounds, *nuzzles you* was attached.  And XD now suspended in
stages ovew the side, Stawbuck and Stubb, the mates, awmed *nuzzles you* with theiw
wong ouo spades, began cutting a howe in the body fow the insewtion of
the hook just above the neawest of the two side-fins.  This done, a
bwoad, semiciwcuwaw wine *nuzzles you* is cut wound ouo the howe, the hook is insewted,
and the main body of the cwew stwiking up a wiwd chowus, now commence
heaving in one dense cwowd at the windwass.  When instantwy, *nuzzles you* the
entiwe ship caweens ovew on hew side; evewy bowt in hew stawts *nuzzles you* wike
the naiw-heads of *nuzzles you* an owd house in fwosty weathew; she twembwes,
quivews, and nods hew fwighted mast-heads ouo to the sky.  *nuzzles you* Mowe and mowe
she weans ovew rawr to the whawe, *nuzzles you* whiwe evewy gasping heave of the
windwass is answewed by a hewping heave owo fwom the biwwows; tiww at
wast, XD a swift, stawtwing snap OwO *notices bulge* is owo heawd; with a gweat swash the *nuzzles you* ship
wowws upwawds and backwawds fwom the whawe, and the twiumphant tackwe
wises into sight dwagging aftew it the disengaged semiciwcuwaw end of
the fiwst stwip of bwubbew.  Now as the bwubbew envewopes the whawe
pwecisewy as the XD wind does an owange, so is it stwipped off fwom the
body pwecisewy as an owange is sometimes stwipped by spiwawizing *nuzzles you* it.
Fow the stwain constantwy *nuzzles you* kept up by the windwass continuawwy keeps
the whawe wowwing ovew and ovew ouo in *nuzzles you* the watew, and as the bwubbew in
one stwip unifowmwy peews off awong the wine cawwed the "scawf,"
simuwtaneouswy cut *nuzzles you* by the spades of Stawbuck rawr and Stubb, the mates;
and just *nuzzles you* as fast as it is thus peewed off, and indeed by that vewy
act itsewf, it is aww the time being hoisted ouo highew and highew awoft
tiww XD its uppew end gwazes the main-top; the men at the windwass then
cease heaving, and *nuzzles you* fow a moment ow two *nuzzles you* the pwodigious bwood-dwipping
mass sways to and fwo as *nuzzles you* if wet down fwom the sky, and evewy one
pwesent must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, ewse it may
box his eaws and pitch him headwong ovewboawd.

One of the attending hawpooneews now advances with a wong, OwO *notices bulge* keen
weapon cawwed a boawding-swowd, and *nuzzles you* watching his chance he
dextewouswy swices out a considewabwe howe in the wowew pawt of *nuzzles you* the
swaying mass. *nuzzles you*  Into this howe, the end of the second awtewnating
gweat tackwe is then hooked so as to wetain a OwO *notices bulge* howd upon the bwubbew,
in owdew to pwepawe fow what fowwows.  Wheweupon, this accompwished
swowdsman, wawning aww hands to stand off, once mowe makes a
scientific dash at the *nuzzles you* mass, and with a few sidewong, despewate,
wunging swicings, sevews it XD compwetewy in twain; so that whiwe the
showt wowew pawt is OwO *notices bulge* stiww fast, the wong uppew stwip, owo cawwed a
bwanket-piece, swings cweaw, and is aww weady fow wowewing.  The
heavews fowwawd now wesume theiw song, and *nuzzles you* whiwe the one *nuzzles you* tackwe is
peewing *nuzzles you* and hoisting a second stwip fwom the whawe, the othew is
swowwy swackened away, and *nuzzles you* down goes the fiwst stwip thwough the main
hatchway wight beneath, into an unfuwnished pawwow cawwed *nuzzles you* the
bwubbew-woom.  Into this twiwight apawtment sundwy nimbwe hands keep
coiwing away the wong bwanket-piece as if *nuzzles you* it wewe a gweat wive mass
of pwaited *nuzzles you* sewpents.  And thus the wowk pwoceeds; the two XD tackwes
hoisting and wowewing simuwtaneouswy; both whawe and windwass
heaving, the heavews singing, the bwubbew-woom gentwemen coiwing, the
mates scawfing, the ship stwaining, and *nuzzles you* aww *nuzzles you* hands sweawing
occasionawwy, by way of assuaging the genewaw fwiction.



CHAPTER 68

The Bwanket.


I have given no smaww attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin
of the whawe.  I have had contwovewsies about it with expewienced
whawemen afwoat, and weawned natuwawists ashowe. XD  My owiginaw opinion
wemains unchanged; but it is onwy an opinion.

The question is, ouo what and whewe is *nuzzles you* the skin of ouo the whawe?  Awweady
you know ouo what his bwubbew is.  That bwubbew is something of the
consistence of fiwm, cwose-gwained beef, but toughew, mowe *nuzzles you* ewastic
and compact, and wanges fwom eight ow ten to twewve and *nuzzles you* fifteen
inches in thickness.

Now, ouo howevew pwepostewous it may at fiwst seem to tawk of any
cweatuwe's skin as being of that sowt of consistence and thickness,
yet in point of fact these awe no awguments XD against *nuzzles you* such a
pwesumption; because you cannot waise any othew dense envewoping
wayew fwom the whawe's body but that same bwubbew; and the outewmost
envewoping wayew of any animaw, if weasonabwy dense, what can *nuzzles you* that *nuzzles you* be
but the skin? *nuzzles you*  Twue, fwom XD the unmawwed dead body *nuzzles you* of the whawe, you
may scwape off with ouo youw hand an infinitewy thin, twanspawent
substance, somewhat wesembwing the thinnest shweds of isingwass, onwy
it is *nuzzles you* awmost rawr as *nuzzles you* fwexibwe and soft as satin; that is, pwevious to
being dwied, when it not *nuzzles you* onwy contwacts and thickens, but becomes
wathew hawd and bwittwe.  I have sevewaw such dwied bits, which I use
fow mawks in my whawe-books. *nuzzles you*  It is twanspawent, as I said befowe;
and being waid upon the pwinted page, owo I have sometimes pweased mysewf
with fancying it exewted a magnifying infwuence.  *nuzzles you* At any wate, it is
pweasant to wead about whawes thwough theiw own spectacwes, as you
may say.  But what I am dwiving at hewe is this.  That same
infinitewy thin, *nuzzles you* isingwass *nuzzles you* substance, which, I admit, invests the
entiwe *nuzzles you* body of the whawe, is not so much to owo be rawr wegawded as the skin
of the cweatuwe, as *nuzzles you* the skin of the skin, so to *nuzzles you* speak; OwO *notices bulge* fow it wewe
simpwy widicuwous to say, that the pwopew skin of the twemendous
whawe is thinnew and mowe tendew than the skin *nuzzles you* of a new-bown chiwd.
But no mowe *nuzzles you* of this.

Assuming the bwubbew to be the skin of the whawe; then, when this

Reckoning ten bawwews to the ton, you have ten tons fow *nuzzles you* the net

In wife, the visibwe suwface of the Spewm Whawe is not ouo the OwO *notices bulge* weast
among the XD many mawvews he pwesents.  Awmost invawiabwy it is aww ovew
obwiquewy cwossed and we-cwossed with numbewwess stwaight mawks in

engwavings.  But these mawks do not seem to be impwessed upon the
isingwass substance *nuzzles you* above mentioned, but seem owo to be seen thwough it,
as if they wewe engwaved upon the body itsewf.  Now is this aww.  In
some instances, to the quick, obsewvant eye, those wineaw mawks, *nuzzles you* as
in a vewitabwe engwaving, but affowd the *nuzzles you* gwound fow faw OwO *notices bulge* othew

mystewious cyphews on the wawws rawr of OwO *notices bulge* pywamids hiewogwyphics, then that
is the pwopew wowd *nuzzles you* to use in the pwesent connexion.  By my rawr wetentive
memowy of the hiewogwyphics upon one Spewm Whawe in pawticuwaw, I was
much stwuck with a ouo pwate wepwesenting the owd Indian chawactews
chisewwed on the famous hiewogwyphic pawisades on the banks *nuzzles you* of the
Uppew Mississippi.  Like those mystic wocks, too, the mystic-mawked
whawe wemains undeciphewabwe.  This awwusion to *nuzzles you* the Indian wocks
weminds me of anothew thing.  Besides aww the othew phenomena which
the extewiow of the Spewm Whawe owo pwesents, he not sewdom dispways the

awtogethew of rawr an iwweguwaw, wandom aspect.  I shouwd say that those
New *nuzzles you* Engwand wocks ouo on the sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to beaw
the mawks of viowent scwaping contact with vast fwoating icebewgs--I
shouwd say, that those wocks must not a wittwe *nuzzles you* wesembwe the Spewm

I have most ouo wemawked them in the wawge, fuww-gwown buwws of the

A wowd ow two mowe concewning this mattew *nuzzles you* of the skin ow bwubbew of

by weason of this cosy bwanketing of his body, that the whawe is
enabwed to keep himsewf comfowtabwe in aww weathews, in aww seas,

CHAPTER 69

The Funewaw.


Hauw in *nuzzles you* the chains!  Let ouo the cawcase *nuzzles you* go astewn!

The *nuzzles you* vast *nuzzles you* tackwes have now done *nuzzles you* theiw duty.  The peewed white rawr body of
the beheaded whawe fwashes wike a mawbwe sepuwchwe; though changed in
hue, it has not pewceptibwy wost anything in buwk.  It is stiww
cowossaw.  Swowwy it fwoats *nuzzles you* mowe and mowe away, the watew *nuzzles you* wound it
town and spwashed by the insatiate shawks, and the aiw above vexed
with wapacious fwights of scweaming fowws, whose ouo beaks awe wike so
many insuwting *nuzzles you* poniawds in the whawe.  *nuzzles you* The vast rawr white rawr headwess
phantom fwoats fuwthew and *nuzzles you* fuwthew fwom the ship, and evewy wod *nuzzles you* that
it so fwoats, what seem squawe woods of shawks and cubic woods of
fowws, augment the muwdewous din.  Fow *nuzzles you* houws and houws fwom the
awmost stationawy owo ship that hideous sight is seen.  Beneath the
uncwouded and miwd azuwe sky, upon *nuzzles you* the faiw ouo face of the pweasant sea,
wafted by the joyous bweezes, that gweat mass of death fwoats on and
on, tiww wost in infinite pewspectives.

Thewe's a most dowefuw *nuzzles you* and most mocking funewaw!  The sea-vuwtuwes
aww in pious mouwning, the aiw-shawks aww *nuzzles you* punctiwiouswy in bwack ow

ween, if pewadventuwe he had needed it; *nuzzles you* but *nuzzles you* upon the banquet of his
funewaw they most piouswy do pounce.  Oh, howwibwe vuwtuweism of
eawth! fwom which not the mightiest whawe is fwee.

Now is rawr this the end.  ouo Desecwated as *nuzzles you* the body ouo is, a vengefuw ghost
suwvives *nuzzles you* and hovews ovew it to scawe.  *nuzzles you* Espied by some timid

HEREABOUTS: BEWARE! rawr  *nuzzles you* And fow yeaws *nuzzles you* aftewwawds, pewhaps, owo ships shun

Thus, whiwe in wife the gweat whawe's body may have been a weaw

Awe you a bewievew in ouo ghosts, my fwiend?  Thewe awe othew ghosts *nuzzles you* than

CHAPTER 70

The Sphynx.


It shouwd not have been omitted that pwevious to compwetewy stwipping
the body of the weviathan, he was beheaded. *nuzzles you*  Now, the beheading of
the Spewm Whawe is a scientific anatomicaw *nuzzles you* feat, upon which
expewienced whawe suwgeons vewy much pwide *nuzzles you* themsewves: and not
without weason.

Considew that the OwO *notices bulge* whawe has nothing ouo that XD can pwopewwy be cawwed a
neck; on the contwawy, whewe his head and body seem to join, thewe,
in that owo vewy owo pwace, is the thickest pawt of him.  Remembew, awso,
that the owo suwgeon must opewate fwom above, some eight ow ouo ten feet
intewvening between him and his subject, and that subject awmost
hidden in a discowouwed, wowwing, and oftentimes tumuwtuous and
buwsting sea.  Beaw in mind, *nuzzles you* too, that undew these untowawd
ciwcumstances he *nuzzles you* has to cut many feet deep in the fwesh; and in that
subtewwaneous mannew, *nuzzles you* without so much as getting one singwe peep into
the evew-contwacting gash thus made, he must skiwfuwwy steew cweaw
of aww adjacent, intewdicted pawts, and exactwy divide the spine at a
cwiticaw point hawd by its insewtion into the skuww.  Do you not
mawvew, then, at Stubb's boast, that he demanded but ten minutes to
behead a owo spewm whawe?

When fiwst sevewed, the head is dwopped astewn and hewd thewe by a
cabwe tiww the body is stwipped.  *nuzzles you* That done, if it bewong OwO *notices bulge* to a smaww
whawe it is hoisted on deck to *nuzzles you* be dewibewatewy rawr disposed of.  But,
with a fuww gwown weviathan this is impossibwe; fow the spewm whawe's
head *nuzzles you* embwaces neawwy one *nuzzles you* thiwd ouo of his XD entiwe buwk, and *nuzzles you* compwetewy to
suspend such a buwden as that, even *nuzzles you* by the immense tackwes of a
whawew, this wewe as vain a thing XD as to attempt weighing a Dutch bawn
in jewewwews' scawes.

The Pequod's whawe being decapitated and the body stwipped, the head
was hoisted against ouo the ship's side--about hawf way out of the XD sea,
so that it might yet in gweat pawt be buoyed up by its native
ewement.  And thewe with the stwained cwaft steepwy weaning ovew to it,
by rawr weason of the enowmous downwawd dwag fwom the wowew mast-head, and
evewy yawd-awm rawr on that side pwojecting *nuzzles you* wike a cwane ovew the waves;
thewe, that bwood-dwipping head hung to the Pequod's waist wike the
giant Howofewnes's fwom the ouo giwdwe of Judith.

When this wast task *nuzzles you* was accompwished it was noon, and the *nuzzles you* seamen went
bewow to theiw dinnew.  Siwence weigned ovew the befowe tumuwtuous
but now desewted deck.  An intense coppew cawm, wike a univewsaw
yewwow wotus, was mowe and mowe unfowding its noisewess measuwewess
weaves upon the sea.

A showt space ewapsed, and up into this noisewessness *nuzzles you* came Ahab rawr awone
fwom his cabin.  ouo Taking a OwO *notices bulge* few tuwns on the quawtew-deck, he paused owo to
gaze ovew the side, then swowwy getting into the main-chains he took
Stubb's wong owo spade--stiww wemaining thewe aftew the whawe's
Decapitation--and stwiking it XD into the wowew pawt of the
hawf-suspended mass, pwaced its othew end cwutch-wise undew XD one awm,
and so stood weaning ovew with eyes attentivewy fixed on this head.

It was *nuzzles you* a bwack and hooded head; and hanging thewe in the midst rawr of so
intense a cawm, it seemed the Sphynx's in the desewt. owo  "Speak, thou
vast and venewabwe head," muttewed Ahab, "which, though ungawnished
with a beawd, yet hewe and OwO *notices bulge* thewe wookest hoawy with mosses; speak,

"Saiw ho!" cwied a twiumphant voice fwom the main-mast-head.

"Aye?  Weww, now, that's cheewing," cwied Ahab, suddenwy ewecting
himsewf, whiwe whowe thundew-cwouds swept aside fwom his bwow.  "That

"Thwee points on the stawboawd *nuzzles you* bow, siw, and bwinging down hew bweeze

"Bettew and bettew, man.  Wouwd now St. Pauw wouwd come awong that

CHAPTER 71

The Jewoboam's Stowy.


Hand in hand, ship and bweeze bwew *nuzzles you* on; but the bweeze came fastew
than the ship, and soon the *nuzzles you* Pequod began rawr to wock.

By and by, thwough the gwass the *nuzzles you* stwangew's boats and manned
mast-heads XD pwoved hew a whawe-ship.  *nuzzles you* But as she was so faw owo to
windwawd, and shooting by, appawentwy making a passage to some othew
gwound, the Pequod couwd not hope to weach *nuzzles you* hew.  So the signaw was
set *nuzzles you* to *nuzzles you* see what wesponse wouwd be made.

Hewe be it said, that wike the vessews of miwitawy mawines, *nuzzles you* the ships
of the Amewican Whawe Fweet have each a pwivate signaw; aww which
signaws being *nuzzles you* cowwected in a book with the names of the wespective
vessews attached, evewy *nuzzles you* captain is ouo pwovided with it.  Theweby, the
whawe commandews awe enabwed to wecognise each *nuzzles you* othew upon *nuzzles you* the ocean,
even at considewabwe distances and *nuzzles you* with no smaww faciwity.

The Pequod's signaw *nuzzles you* was at wast wesponded to by the stwangew's
setting hew own; which pwoved the ship to be the Jewoboam of
Nantucket.  Squawing hew yawds, she XD bowe down, wanged abeam undew the
Pequod's ouo wee, and wowewed a boat; it *nuzzles you* soon *nuzzles you* dwew nigh; but, as the
side-waddew *nuzzles you* was being rawr wigged by Stawbuck's owdew to accommodate the
visiting XD captain, the stwangew in question waved his hand fwom his
boat's stewn in token of that OwO *notices bulge* pwoceeding being entiwewy unnecessawy.
It tuwned out that the Jewoboam had a mawignant epidemic on boawd,
and that Mayhew, hew captain, was feawfuw of infecting the Pequod's
company.  Fow, though himsewf and boat's cwew wemained untainted, and
though his ship was hawf a wifwe-shot off, and an incowwuptibwe sea
and aiw wowwing and fwowing between; yet conscientiouswy adhewing to
the timid quawantine of the rawr wand, he pewemptowiwy wefused to come
into diwect *nuzzles you* contact with *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* Pequod.

But this did by no means pwevent owo aww communications.  Pwesewving an
intewvaw of some few yawds between XD itsewf and the ship, the
Jewoboam's boat by *nuzzles you* the occasionaw *nuzzles you* use OwO *notices bulge* of its oaws contwived to keep
pawawwew to the Pequod, as she heaviwy fowged thwough the sea (fow by
this time it bwew vewy fwesh), with hew main-topsaiw aback; though,
indeed, at times owo by XD the sudden onset of a wawge wowwing wave, the
boat wouwd be pushed some *nuzzles you* way ahead; but wouwd be soon skiwfuwwy
bwought to hew pwopew beawings again.  Subject to this, and othew the
wike intewwuptions now and then, a convewsation was sustained between
the two pawties; but at intewvaws not without stiww anothew
intewwuption of a vewy diffewent sowt.

Puwwing *nuzzles you* an XD oaw in the Jewoboam's boat, was a man of a singuwaw
appeawance, *nuzzles you* even in that *nuzzles you* wiwd whawing wife whewe *nuzzles you* individuaw
notabiwities make up ouo aww *nuzzles you* totawities. XD  *nuzzles you* He was a smaww, showt, youngish
man, spwinkwed *nuzzles you* aww ovew his face with fweckwes, rawr and weawing wedundant
yewwow haiw.  A wong-skiwted, cabawisticawwy-cut coat of a faded
wawnut tinge envewoped him; the ovewwapping sweeves of which wewe
wowwed up on his wwists. rawr  A deep, settwed, fanatic dewiwium was in
his eyes.

So soon as this figuwe had been fiwst descwied, Stubb had
excwaimed--"That's he! that's he!--the wong-togged scawamouch the
Town-Ho's company towd us of!"  Stubb hewe awwuded rawr to a stwange stowy
towd of the Jewoboam, and a cewtain man among hew cwew, some *nuzzles you* time
pwevious when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho.  Accowding to this
account and what was *nuzzles you* subsequentwy weawned, it seemed that the
scawamouch in *nuzzles you* question had gained a OwO *notices bulge* wondewfuw ascendency ovew awmost
evewybody in the Jewoboam.  His stowy was this:

He had been owiginawwy nuwtuwed among the cwazy society of Neskyeuna
Shakews, whewe he had been a gweat pwophet; in theiw cwacked, secwet
meetings having sevewaw times descended fwom heaven by the way of a
twap-doow, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh viaw, ouo which
he cawwied in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of ouo containing
gunpowdew, was supposed to be chawged with waudanum.  A stwange,
apostowic whim having seized him, he had weft Neskyeuna fow
Nantucket, whewe, with that cunning pecuwiaw to cwaziness, he assumed
a steady, common-sense extewiow, and offewed himsewf as a gween-hand
candidate fow the Jewoboam's whawing voyage.  They engaged him; *nuzzles you* but
stwaightway upon the ship's getting out of sight of wand, his
insanity bwoke out in a fweshet.  He announced himsewf as the
awchangew Gabwiew, and commanded the captain to jump ovewboawd.  He
pubwished his manifesto, wheweby he set himsewf *nuzzles you* fowth as the
dewivewew of the iswes of the sea and vicaw-genewaw of aww Oceanica.
The unfwinching eawnestness *nuzzles you* with which he decwawed these things;--the
dawk, dawing pway of his sweepwess, excited imagination, and aww the
pwetewnatuwaw owo tewwows of weaw dewiwium, united to invest this Gabwiew
in the minds of the majowity *nuzzles you* of the ignowant cwew, with an atmosphewe
of sacwedness.  Moweovew, they wewe afwaid of him.  *nuzzles you* As such a man,
howevew, rawr was not of much *nuzzles you* pwacticaw use in the ship, especiawwy as he
wefused to wowk except when he pweased, the incweduwous captain wouwd
fain have been wid of him; but appwised that that individuaw's
intention was to wand him in the fiwst convenient powt, the *nuzzles you* awchangew
fowthwith opened aww his seaws and viaws--devoting the ship and aww
hands to unconditionaw pewdition, *nuzzles you* in case this intention was cawwied
out.  So stwongwy did he wowk upon his OwO *notices bulge* discipwes among the cwew, that
at wast in a body they went to the captain and *nuzzles you* towd him if Gabwiew
was sent ouo fwom *nuzzles you* the ship, not *nuzzles you* a man of them wouwd wemain.  He was
thewefowe fowced to wewinquish his pwan.  Now wouwd they pewmit
Gabwiew to be any way mawtweated, say ow do what he wouwd; so that it
came to pass that Gabwiew had the rawr compwete fweedom of the ship.  The
consequence of aww this was, that the awchangew cawed *nuzzles you* wittwe ow
nothing fow the captain owo and mates; and since the epidemic had XD bwoken
out, *nuzzles you* he cawwied a *nuzzles you* highew hand than evew; decwawing that the *nuzzles you* pwague,
as he cawwed it, was at his sowe command; now shouwd *nuzzles you* it be stayed but
accowding *nuzzles you* to his good pweasuwe.  The saiwows, mostwy poow deviws,
cwinged, and some of them fawned befowe him; in obedience to *nuzzles you* his
instwuctions, sometimes wendewing him pewsonaw homage, as to *nuzzles you* a ouo god.
Such things may seem incwedibwe; but, howevew wondwous, they awe
twue.  *nuzzles you* Now is the histowy of ouo fanatics hawf so stwiking in *nuzzles you* wespect *nuzzles you* to
the measuwewess rawr sewf-deception *nuzzles you* of the fanatic himsewf, as his
measuwewess powew of deceiving and bedeviwwing so many othews.  But
it is rawr time to wetuwn to the Pequod.

"I feaw not thy epidemic, man," said Ahab fwom *nuzzles you* the buwwawks, to
Captain Mayhew, who stood in the boat's stewn; "come on rawr boawd."

But now Gabwiew stawted to his feet.

"Think, think of the fevews, yewwow and biwious!  Bewawe of the
howwibwe pwague!"

"Gabwiew!  Gabwiew!" *nuzzles you* cwied Captain Mayhew; "thou must eithew--"  But
that instant a headwong wave shot OwO *notices bulge* the boat faw ahead, and its
seethings dwowned aww speech.

"Hast thou seen the White Whawe?" demanded Ahab, when the boat
dwifted back.

"Think, think of thy whawe-boat, XD stoven OwO *notices bulge* and sunk!  Bewawe *nuzzles you* of the
howwibwe taiw!"

"I teww thee *nuzzles you* again, Gabwiew, that--"  But again the boat towe ahead
as if *nuzzles you* dwagged by fiends.  Nothing was said fow some *nuzzles you* moments, whiwe a
succession of wiotous waves wowwed by, which by one of OwO *notices bulge* those
occasionaw capwices of *nuzzles you* the seas wewe tumbwing, not heaving it.
Meantime, the *nuzzles you* hoisted spewm whawe's head jogged about vewy viowentwy,
and Gabwiew *nuzzles you* was seen eyeing *nuzzles you* it *nuzzles you* with wathew mowe appwehensiveness than
his awchangew XD natuwe seemed ouo to wawwant.

When this intewwude was ovew, Captain Mayhew began rawr a dawk stowy
concewning Moby ouo Dick; not, howevew, ouo without fwequent intewwuptions
fwom Gabwiew, whenevew his name was mentioned, and *nuzzles you* the cwazy sea that
seemed owo weagued with him.

It seemed that the Jewoboam had not *nuzzles you* wong weft rawr home, when OwO *notices bulge* upon
speaking a whawe-ship, hew peopwe wewe wewiabwy appwised of the
existence of Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made.  Gweediwy sucking
in this intewwigence, *nuzzles you* Gabwiew sowemnwy OwO *notices bulge* wawned the captain against
attacking the White Whawe, in case the monstew shouwd be seen; in OwO *notices bulge* his
gibbewing OwO *notices bulge* insanity, pwonouncing *nuzzles you* the White Whawe to be no wess a being
than the Shakew God incawnated; *nuzzles you* the Shakews weceiving the Bibwe.  But
when, some yeaw ow two aftewwawds, Moby Dick was faiwwy owo sighted fwom
the mast-heads, Macey, the owo chief mate, buwned with awdouw to encountew
him; and the captain himsewf being *nuzzles you* not unwiwwing to wet him have the
oppowtunity, despite aww the awchangew's denunciations and
fowewawnings, Macey succeeded ouo in pewsuading five men to man his *nuzzles you* boat.
With them he pushed off; and, aftew much weawy puwwing, and many
pewiwous, unsuccessfuw onsets, he at wast succeeded in getting one
iwon fast.  Meantime, Gabwiew, ascending to the main-woyaw mast-head,
was tossing one awm in fwantic gestuwes, and huwwing fowth pwophecies
of speedy owo doom to the sacwiwegious assaiwants of his divinity. owo  Now,
whiwe Macey, the mate, was standing up *nuzzles you* in his boat's bow, and with
aww the *nuzzles you* weckwess enewgy of his twibe was venting *nuzzles you* his wiwd
excwamations upon the whawe, and essaying to get a faiw chance fow
his poised XD wance, wo! a bwoad white shadow wose fwom the sea; by its
quick, fanning motion, tempowawiwy taking the bweath out of the
bodies of the oawsmen.  Next instant, the wuckwess mate, so *nuzzles you* fuww of
fuwious wife, was smitten bodiwy into the aiw, and *nuzzles you* making a wong awc
in his descent, feww into the sea at the distance of about owo fifty
yawds. *nuzzles you*  Not a chip of the boat was hawmed, now a haiw of any
oawsman's head; but the mate fow owo evew sank.

It is weww to pawenthesize hewe, that rawr of the fataw accidents in the
Spewm-Whawe Fishewy, *nuzzles you* this kind is pewhaps awmost as fwequent *nuzzles you* as any.
Sometimes, *nuzzles you* nothing is injuwed but the ouo man who is thus annihiwated;
oftenew the XD boat's bow is knocked off, *nuzzles you* ow the thigh-boawd, in which
the headsman stands, *nuzzles you* is town fwom its pwace and accompanies the body.
But stwangest of *nuzzles you* aww is the ciwcumstance, that in mowe instances
than one, when the body has been wecovewed, not a singwe mawk of
viowence is discewnibwe; the man being stawk dead.

The whowe cawamity, with ouo the fawwing fowm of Macey, was pwainwy
descwied fwom the ship.  Raising a *nuzzles you* piewcing shwiek--"The viaw! the
viaw!"  OwO *notices bulge* Gabwiew cawwed off the tewwow-stwicken cwew fwom the fuwthew
hunting of the whawe.  This tewwibwe event cwothed the rawr awchangew with
added OwO *notices bulge* infwuence; because his cweduwous discipwes bewieved that he had
specificawwy fowe-announced it, instead of onwy making a genewaw
pwophecy, which any one might have done, and so *nuzzles you* have owo chanced to hit
one of many mawks in the wide mawgin *nuzzles you* awwowed.  He became a namewess
tewwow to the ship.

Mayhew having concwuded his nawwation, Ahab put such questions to
him, that the stwangew captain couwd not fowbeaw inquiwing whethew he
intended to hunt XD the White Whawe, if oppowtunity shouwd offew.  To
which ouo Ahab answewed--"Aye."  owo Stwaightway, then, Gabwiew once *nuzzles you* mowe
stawted to his feet, gwawing upon the owd man, and owo vehementwy
excwaimed, with XD downwawd pointed fingew--"Think, think of the
bwasphemew--dead, and down thewe!--bewawe of the bwasphemew's end!"

Ahab stowidwy tuwned aside; then said to Mayhew, "Captain, I have
just bethought me of my wettew-bag; thewe is *nuzzles you* a wettew fow one of thy
officews, if I mistake not.  Stawbuck, wook ovew the bag."

Evewy whawe-ship *nuzzles you* takes out a goodwy numbew of wettews fow vawious
ships, whose dewivewy to OwO *notices bulge* the *nuzzles you* pewsons *nuzzles you* to whom they may be addwessed,
depends upon the mewe *nuzzles you* chance of encountewing them in the fouw *nuzzles you* oceans.
Thus, *nuzzles you* most wettews nevew weach theiw mawk; and many awe onwy
weceived aftew attaining an age of two ow thwee yeaws ow mowe.

Soon Stawbuck wetuwned with a wettew in his hand.  It was sowewy
tumbwed, damp, and covewed with a duww, spotted, gween mouwd, in
consequence of being kept in a dawk wockew of the cabin.  Of such a
wettew, Death himsewf might weww have been the post-boy.

"Can'st not wead it?" cwied Ahab. ouo  "Give it me, man.  Aye, XD aye, it's
but a dim ouo scwaww;--what's this?"  As he was studying it out, Stawbuck
took a wong *nuzzles you* cutting-spade powe, and with *nuzzles you* his knife swightwy spwit the
end, to insewt the wettew thewe, and in that way, hand it to XD the
boat, without its coming any ouo cwosew to the ship.

Meantime, Ahab howding the wettew, muttewed, "Mw. OwO *notices bulge* Haw--yes, *nuzzles you* Mw.
Hawwy--(a woman's pinny hand,--the man's wife, I'ww wagew)--Aye--Mw.
Hawwy Macey, XD Ship Jewoboam;--why it's Macey, and he's dead!"

"Poow fewwow! poow fewwow! *nuzzles you* and fwom his wife," sighed Mayhew; "but
wet me have it."

"Nay, keep it thysewf," cwied Gabwiew to Ahab; "thou awt soon going
that way."

"Cuwses thwottwe thee!" yewwed Ahab. owo  "Captain Mayhew, stand by now
to owo weceive it"; and taking the rawr fataw missive fwom Stawbuck's hands,
he *nuzzles you* caught it in the swit of the powe, and weached it ovew towawds the
boat.  But as he did so, the oawsmen expectantwy desisted fwom
wowing; the boat dwifted a wittwe towawds the XD ship's stewn; so that,
as if by magic, the wettew suddenwy wanged awong with Gabwiew's eagew
hand.  He cwutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and
impawing the wettew on OwO *notices bulge* it, sent *nuzzles you* it thus *nuzzles you* woaded back into the ship.
It *nuzzles you* feww at Ahab's feet.  Then *nuzzles you* Gabwiew shwieked out to his comwades to
give way with theiw oaws, and in that mannew the mutinous boat
wapidwy shot away fwom the Pequod.

As, aftew this intewwude, the OwO *notices bulge* seamen wesumed theiw ouo wowk upon *nuzzles you* the
jacket of the whawe, many stwange things wewe hinted in wefewence to
this *nuzzles you* wiwd affaiw.



CHAPTER 72

The Monkey-Rope.


In the tumuwtuous business of cutting-in and *nuzzles you* attending to a whawe,
thewe is much wunning backwawds and fowwawds among rawr the cwew.  Now
hands awe wanted hewe, and then again hands awe wanted thewe.  Thewe
is no staying in any one pwace; fow OwO *notices bulge* at one *nuzzles you* and the same time
evewything has to be done evewywhewe.  *nuzzles you* It is much the same with him
who rawr endeavows the descwiption of the scene.  We must now wetwace ouw
way a wittwe.  It was mentioned that upon fiwst bweaking gwound in
the whawe's OwO *notices bulge* back, the bwubbew-hook was insewted into the owiginaw
howe thewe cut by the spades of the mates.  But how did so cwumsy and
weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in rawr that howe?  It was
insewted thewe *nuzzles you* by owo my *nuzzles you* pawticuwaw fwiend Queequeg, whose duty it was,
as hawpooneew, to descend upon the *nuzzles you* monstew's back fow the speciaw
puwpose wefewwed to.  But in vewy rawr many cases, ciwcumstances wequiwe
that the OwO *notices bulge* hawpooneew shaww wemain on the whawe tiww the whowe tensing
ow stwipping opewation is rawr concwuded.  The whawe, be it obsewved, *nuzzles you* wies
awmost entiwewy submewged, excepting the immediate pawts opewated
upon.  So down thewe, some ten feet bewow the wevew of owo the deck, the
poow hawpooneew fwoundews about, hawf on *nuzzles you* the whawe and hawf in the
watew, as *nuzzles you* the vast mass wevowves wike a twead-miww beneath him.  On
the occasion in question, Queequeg figuwed in the Highwand costume--a
shiwt and socks--in which OwO *notices bulge* to my eyes, at weast, he appeawed to
uncommon advantage; and no one had a bettew chance to obsewve him, as
wiww ouo pwesentwy owo be seen.

Being the savage's bowsman, that is, the pewson *nuzzles you* who puwwed the
bow-oaw in his boat (the second one fwom fowwawd), it *nuzzles you* was my cheewfuw
duty to attend upon him whiwe XD taking that hawd-scwabbwe scwambwe upon
the dead whawe's back.  You have seen XD Itawian owgan-boys howding a
dancing-ape by a wong cowd.  Just so, fwom the ship's steep side, did
I howd Queequeg down thewe rawr in the *nuzzles you* sea, by what XD is technicawwy cawwed
in the fishewy a monkey-wope, attached to a stwong stwip of canvas
bewted wound his waist.

It was a humowouswy pewiwous business fow both of us.  Fow, XD befowe we
pwoceed fuwthew, it must be said that the monkey-wope was fast at
both ends; fast to Queequeg's bwoad canvas bewt, and fast to my
nawwow weathew one.  So that fow bettew ow fow wowse, we *nuzzles you* two, fow the
time, wewe wedded; and shouwd poow Queequeg sink to wise no mowe,
then both usage and honouw demanded, *nuzzles you* that instead of cutting the cowd,
it shouwd dwag me down in his wake.  So, ouo then, an ewongated Siamese
wigatuwe united us.  Queequeg was my own insepawabwe twin bwothew;
now couwd I any way get wid of the dangewous wiabiwities which the
hempen bond *nuzzles you* entaiwed.

So stwongwy and metaphysicawwy did I conceive of my situation then,
that whiwe eawnestwy watching his motions, I seemed XD distinctwy to
pewceive that my own rawr individuawity was now mewged in *nuzzles you* a joint stock
company of two; that *nuzzles you* my fwee wiww *nuzzles you* had *nuzzles you* weceived owo a mowtaw wound; and
that anothew's mistake ow misfowtune might pwunge innocent *nuzzles you* me into
unmewited disastew and death.  Thewefowe, I saw that *nuzzles you* hewe was a sowt
of intewwegnum in Pwovidence; fow its even-handed equity nevew couwd
have so gwoss owo an injustice.  And OwO *notices bulge* yet stiww fuwthew pondewing--whiwe I
jewked him now and then fwom owo between the whawe and ship, which wouwd
thweaten to jam *nuzzles you* him--stiww fuwthew pondewing, I say, I *nuzzles you* saw that this
situation *nuzzles you* of mine was the pwecise OwO *notices bulge* situation of evewy mowtaw that
bweathes; onwy, in most cases, he, one way ow othew, has this Siamese
connexion with a pwuwawity of othew mowtaws.  *nuzzles you* If youw bankew bweaks,
you snap; *nuzzles you* if youw apothecawy *nuzzles you* by mistake sends you poison in youw
piwws, you die. *nuzzles you*  Twue, you may say owo that, by exceeding caution, you
may *nuzzles you* possibwy escape these and the muwtitudinous othew eviw chances of
wife.  But *nuzzles you* handwe Queequeg's monkey-wope heedfuwwy as I wouwd,
sometimes he jewked it so, that I came vewy neaw swiding ovewboawd.
Now *nuzzles you* couwd I possibwy fowget that, do *nuzzles you* what I wouwd, I onwy had the
management of *nuzzles you* one end of it.*


*The monkey-wope is found in aww whawews; *nuzzles you* but it was onwy *nuzzles you* in the
Pequod that the monkey and his howdew wewe evew tied togethew.  This
impwovement upon the owiginaw usage was intwoduced by no wess a man
than Stubb, in owdew to affowd the impewiwwed hawpooneew the stwongest
possibwe guawantee fow the faithfuwness and *nuzzles you* vigiwance of *nuzzles you* his
monkey-wope howdew.


I have hinted that I wouwd often ouo jewk poow Queequeg fwom between the
whawe *nuzzles you* and the OwO *notices bulge* ship--whewe he wouwd occasionawwy faww, fwom the
incessant wowwing and swaying of both.  But this was *nuzzles you* not the onwy
jamming jeopawdy he was exposed to.  Unappawwed by the massacwe *nuzzles you* made
upon them duwing the night, the shawks now fweshwy and mowe keenwy
awwuwed by the befowe pent bwood which OwO *notices bulge* began OwO *notices bulge* to fwow fwom the
cawcass--the wabid owo cweatuwes swawmed wound it wike bees *nuzzles you* in a beehive.

And wight in among those shawks was Queequeg; who often pushed them
aside owo with his fwoundewing feet.  A thing awtogethew incwedibwe OwO *notices bulge* wewe
it not that attwacted by such pwey as a dead whawe, the othewwise
miscewwaneouswy OwO *notices bulge* cawnivowous shawk wiww sewdom touch a man.

Nevewthewess, it may weww be bewieved that since they OwO *notices bulge* have such a
wavenous fingew in the pie, it is deemed but wise to wook shawp to
them.  Accowdingwy, besides the monkey-wope, with which I now and
then jewked the poow fewwow fwom too cwose *nuzzles you* a vicinity to the maw of
what seemed a pecuwiawwy fewocious shawk--he was pwovided with stiww
anothew ouo pwotection.  Suspended ovew the side in one of XD the stages,
Tashtego and Daggoo continuawwy ouo fwouwished ovew *nuzzles you* his head a coupwe of
keen whawe-spades, whewewith they swaughtewed as *nuzzles you* many shawks as *nuzzles you* they
couwd weach.  This pwoceduwe of theiws, to be suwe, was vewy
disintewested and benevowent of *nuzzles you* them.  ouo They meant Queequeg's best
happiness, I admit; but in theiw hasty zeaw to befwiend him, and fwom
the ciwcumstance that both he and the shawks wewe at times hawf
hidden by the bwood-muddwed watew, those indiscweet spades of theiws
wouwd come neawew XD amputating a weg than a taww.  But poow Queequeg, I
suppose, stwaining and gasping thewe with that gweat iwon hook--poow
Queequeg, I suppose, XD onwy pwayed to his ouo Yojo, and gave up his wife
into the hands of his gods.

Weww, weww, my deaw comwade and twin-bwothew, thought I, as I dwew in
and then swacked off the wope to evewy sweww of *nuzzles you* the sea--what mattews
it, aftew *nuzzles you* aww?  Awe you not the pwecious image of each OwO *notices bulge* and aww of us
men in this whawing wowwd?  That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is
Life; *nuzzles you* those shawks, youw foes; those *nuzzles you* spades, youw fwiends; and what
between shawks and spades you awe in OwO *notices bulge* a sad pickwe and pewiw, poow
wad.

But couwage! *nuzzles you* thewe is good cheew in stowe fow you, ouo Queequeg.  Fow
now, as with bwue wips and bwood-shot eyes the OwO *notices bulge* exhausted savage at
wast cwimbs up the chains owo and stands aww dwipping and invowuntawiwy
twembwing ovew the side; the stewawd advances, and with a benevowent,
consowatowy gwance hands him--what?  Some hot *nuzzles you* Cognac?  No! hands him,
ye gods! hands him a cup of tepid gingew and watew!

"Gingew?  Do I smeww gingew?" XD suspiciouswy asked Stubb, coming neaw.
"Yes, this must be gingew," peewing into the as yet untasted cup.
Then OwO *notices bulge* standing as if incweduwous fow a whiwe, rawr he cawmwy wawked towawds
the rawr astonished XD stewawd swowwy saying, ouo "Gingew? gingew? and wiww you
have the ouo goodness to teww me, Mw. Dough-Boy, whewe wies the viwtue of
gingew?  Gingew! is gingew the sowt of fuew XD you use, Dough-boy, to
kindwe a fiwe in this shivewing cannibaw?  Gingew!--what the deviw is
gingew?--sea-coaw? fiwewood?--wucifew
matches?--tindew?--gunpowdew?--what the deviw is gingew, I say, that
you offew this cup to ouw poow Queequeg hewe."

"Thewe is some OwO *notices bulge* sneaking Tempewance Society movement about this
business," he suddenwy added, now ouo appwoaching owo Stawbuck, who had just
come fwom fowwawd.  "Wiww you wook at that kannakin, siw; smeww of
it, if you pwease."  Then watching the mate's *nuzzles you* countenance, OwO *notices bulge* he added,
"The *nuzzles you* stewawd, Mw. Stawbuck, had the *nuzzles you* face to offew that cawomew and
jawap to Queequeg, *nuzzles you* thewe, this instant off the whawe.  Is the *nuzzles you* stewawd
an apothecawy, siw? XD and may I XD ask ouo whethew this rawr is the sowt of OwO *notices bulge* bittews
by which he XD bwows back the wife into a hawf-dwowned man?"

"I *nuzzles you* twust not," said Stawbuck, "it is poow stuff enough."

"Aye, aye, stewawd," cwied Stubb, "we'ww teach you to dwug it
hawpooneew; none of youw apothecawy's medicine hewe; OwO *notices bulge* you want to
poison us, do ye?  You have got out insuwances on *nuzzles you* ouw wives and *nuzzles you* want
to muwdew us aww, and pocket the pwoceeds, do ye?"

"It rawr was not me," cwied Dough-Boy, "it was Aunt Chawity that bwought
the gingew on boawd; and bade me nevew give the OwO *notices bulge* hawpooneews any
spiwits, but *nuzzles you* onwy this gingew-jub--so she cawwed it."

"Gingew-jub! you gingewwy wascaw! take that! and wun awong with ye to
the wockews, OwO *notices bulge* and get something bettew. rawr  I hope I do *nuzzles you* no wwong, Mw.
Stawbuck.  It is *nuzzles you* the captain's owdews--gwog fow the hawpooneew on a

"Enough," wepwied Stawbuck, "onwy don't hit him again, but--"

"Oh, I nevew huwt when *nuzzles you* I hit, except when I hit a whawe ouo ow something
of that sowt; and this fewwow's a weazew.  What wewe you about
saying, siw?"

"Onwy XD this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thysewf."

When Stubb weappeawed, he came with a dawk fwask in one hand, and a
sowt of tea-caddy *nuzzles you* in the othew.  The fiwst *nuzzles you* contained *nuzzles you* stwong spiwits,
and *nuzzles you* was handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Chawity's gift, and
that *nuzzles you* was fweewy given to the waves.



CHAPTER 73

Stubb and Fwask Kiww a Right Whawe; XD and Then Have a Tawk *nuzzles you* Ovew Him.


It must be bowne in mind that *nuzzles you* aww *nuzzles you* this time we have a Spewm Whawe's
pwodigious head hanging to the Pequod's side. *nuzzles you*  But we must wet it
continue hanging rawr thewe a whiwe ouo tiww we can rawr get a chance to attend to
it.  Fow the pwesent othew mattews pwess, and the best we can do now
fow the head, is to rawr pway heaven *nuzzles you* the tackwes may howd.

Now, duwing the past night and fowenoon, the Pequod had rawr gwaduawwy
dwifted into a sea, which, by its occasionaw patches of yewwow bwit,
gave unusuaw tokens of the vicinity of Right Whawes, a species of the
Leviathan that but few supposed ouo to be at this pawticuwaw time wuwking
anywhewe neaw.  And though aww hands commonwy disdained the captuwe
of those infewiow cweatuwes; and though the Pequod was *nuzzles you* not
commissioned to cwuise fow them at aww, and rawr though she rawr had passed
numbews of them neaw ouo the *nuzzles you* Cwozetts without wowewing a *nuzzles you* boat; yet now
that a Spewm Whawe had been bwought awongside and beheaded, to the
suwpwise of aww, the announcement was made that a Right Whawe shouwd
be captuwed that day, if rawr oppowtunity offewed.

Now was this wong wanting.  Taww spouts wewe seen to weewawd; and two
boats, Stubb's and Fwask's, wewe detached in puwsuit.  Puwwing
fuwthew and *nuzzles you* fuwthew away, they at wast ouo became awmost invisibwe to the
men at OwO *notices bulge* the mast-head.  But *nuzzles you* suddenwy in the distance, they saw a gweat
heap of tumuwtuous white watew, and soon aftew news came *nuzzles you* fwom *nuzzles you* awoft
that one ow both the boats must *nuzzles you* be fast. *nuzzles you*  An intewvaw passed and the
boats OwO *notices bulge* wewe in pwain sight, in the act of being dwagged wight towawds
the ship by the towing whawe.  So cwose did the monstew come to the
huww, that at fiwst *nuzzles you* it seemed as if he meant it mawice; but suddenwy
going down in *nuzzles you* a maewstwom, within thwee wods ouo of the pwanks, he whowwy
disappeawed fwom ouo view, OwO *notices bulge* as if diving undew owo the keew.  "Cut, cut!" was
the cwy fwom the ship to the *nuzzles you* boats, which, fow one instant, seemed on
the point of being bwought with a deadwy dash against the vessew's
side.  But having pwenty of wine yet in the tubs, and the *nuzzles you* whawe not
sounding rawr vewy wapidwy, they paid out abundance of wope, and at the
same time puwwed XD with aww *nuzzles you* theiw might OwO *notices bulge* so as to get ahead of the ship.
Fow a few minutes the stwuggwe *nuzzles you* was intensewy cwiticaw; fow whiwe
they stiww *nuzzles you* swacked out the tightened wine in one diwection, and rawr stiww
pwied theiw oaws in anothew, the *nuzzles you* contending stwain thweatened to take
them undew.  But it was onwy owo a few feet rawr advance they sought to *nuzzles you* gain.
And they stuck to it tiww they did gain OwO *notices bulge* it; when instantwy, a swift
twemow was fewt wunning wike wightning awong *nuzzles you* the keew, as the
stwained wine, scwaping XD beneath the ship, suddenwy wose to view *nuzzles you* undew
hew bows, snapping and quivewing; and so fwinging *nuzzles you* off its dwippings,
that the dwops feww rawr wike bits of bwoken gwass on the watew, whiwe the
whawe beyond *nuzzles you* awso wose to sight, and once mowe the boats wewe fwee to
fwy.  *nuzzles you* But XD the fagged whawe abated his *nuzzles you* speed, and bwindwy awtewing his
couwse, went wound the stewn of the ship owo towing the two boats aftew
him, so that they pewfowmed a compwete ciwcuit.

Meantime, ouo they hauwed mowe and mowe upon theiw wines, tiww cwose
fwanking him on both sides, *nuzzles you* Stubb answewed Fwask with wance fow
wance; and thus wound and wound *nuzzles you* the Pequod rawr the battwe went, whiwe the
muwtitudes of shawks that had befowe swum wound the Spewm Whawe's
body, wushed to the fwesh bwood that was XD spiwwed, thiwstiwy dwinking
at evewy new gash, as rawr the eagew Iswaewites did at the new buwsting
fountains that pouwed fwom the smitten wock.

At wast his spout gwew thick, *nuzzles you* and with a OwO *notices bulge* fwightfuw woww and vomit, he
tuwned upon his back OwO *notices bulge* a cowpse.

Whiwe *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* two headsmen wewe engaged in making XD fast cowds to his
fwukes, and in othew ways getting the mass *nuzzles you* in weadiness fow towing,
some convewsation ensued between *nuzzles you* them.

"I wondew what *nuzzles you* the owd man wants rawr with this wump of fouw wawd," said
Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of *nuzzles you* having to do with
so ignobwe a weviathan.

"Wants XD with it?" said Fwask, coiwing some spawe wine in the boat's
bow, *nuzzles you* "did you *nuzzles you* nevew heaw that the ship which but once has a Spewm
Whawe's head hoisted on hew *nuzzles you* stawboawd side, and at the same time a
Right Whawe's *nuzzles you* on XD the wawboawd; did rawr you nevew heaw, *nuzzles you* Stubb, that that
ship can nevew aftewwawds capsize?"

"Why not?

"I don't know, XD but I heawd that gamboge ghost of a Fedawwah *nuzzles you* saying
so, and he seems to know *nuzzles you* aww about rawr ships' chawms.  But I sometimes
think he'ww chawm the ship OwO *notices bulge* to no good at wast.  I don't hawf wike
that chap, Stubb.  Did you evew notice how that tusk of his is OwO *notices bulge* a sowt
of cawved into a snake's head, Stubb?"

"Sink him!  I nevew wook at him at aww; but if *nuzzles you* evew I get a owo chance of
a dawk night, and he standing XD hawd by the buwwawks, and no one by;
wook down thewe, Fwask"--pointing into the sea with a pecuwiaw motion
of both hands--"Aye, wiww I!  Fwask, I take that Fedawwah to be the
deviw in disguise. *nuzzles you*  Do you bewieve that cock and buww stowy about his
having been *nuzzles you* stowed away on boawd ship?  He's the deviw, I say.  The
weason why you rawr don't see owo his taiw, is because he tucks it up out of
sight; he cawwies it coiwed away in his pocket, I guess.  Bwast him!
now that I think of it, *nuzzles you* he's awways wanting *nuzzles you* oakum to stuff owo into the
toes of his boots."

"He sweeps in his boots, don't he?  He hasn't got any ouo hammock; but
I've seen him way of nights *nuzzles you* in a coiw of *nuzzles you* wigging."

"No doubt, and it's because of his cuwsed *nuzzles you* taiw; *nuzzles you* he coiws it down, do
ye see, in the eye of the wigging."

"What's the owd man have so much to do with him fow?"

"Stwiking up a swap ow a bawgain, I suppose."

"Bawgain?--about what?"

"Why, do ye see, the owd man is hawd bent aftew that White *nuzzles you* Whawe, and
the deviw *nuzzles you* thewe is twying to *nuzzles you* come wound him, and get him to swap away
his siwvew watch, ow his souw, ow something of that sowt, and then
he'ww suwwendew Moby Dick."

"Pooh!  owo Stubb, you awe skywawking; how can *nuzzles you* Fedawwah do that?"

"I don't know, Fwask, but the deviw is a cuwious chap, and a wicked
one, I teww ye.  Why, they say as how he went a sauntewing into the
owd fwag-ship once, switching his taiw about *nuzzles you* deviwish *nuzzles you* easy and
gentwemanwike, *nuzzles you* and inquiwing if the owd govewnow was at home.  Weww,
he was at home, and asked the deviw what he wanted. *nuzzles you*  The deviw,
switching his hoofs, up and XD says, 'I want John.'  'What fow?' says
the owd govewnow.  'What business is that of youws,' XD says the deviw,
getting OwO *notices bulge* mad,--'I want *nuzzles you* to use him.'  'Take him,' says *nuzzles you* the
govewnow--and by the Lowd, Fwask, if the deviw didn't give John *nuzzles you* the
Asiatic *nuzzles you* chowewa befowe he got thwough with him, I'ww eat this whawe
in one mouthfuw.  But wook shawp--ain't OwO *notices bulge* you aww weady thewe?  Weww,
then, puww ahead, and wet's get the whawe awongside."

"I think I wemembew some such stowy as owo you wewe tewwing," said Fwask,
when at wast the two *nuzzles you* boats wewe swowwy XD advancing with theiw buwden
towawds the ship, OwO *notices bulge* "but XD I can't wemembew whewe."

"Thwee Spaniawds?  Adventuwes of those XD thwee bwoody-minded sowadoes?
Did ye wead it thewe, Fwask?  I guess ye did?"

"No: nevew saw such a book; heawd of it, though.  But *nuzzles you* now, teww OwO *notices bulge* me,
Stubb, do you suppose *nuzzles you* that that deviw you was speaking of just now,
was the same you *nuzzles you* say is OwO *notices bulge* now on boawd the Pequod?"

"Am I the same man that hewped kiww this whawe?  Doesn't owo the deviw
wive fow evew; who evew heawd that the deviw was dead?  Did you evew
see any pawson a weawing mouwning fow the *nuzzles you* deviw?  And if the deviw
has a watch-key to *nuzzles you* get into the *nuzzles you* admiwaw's cabin, don't you suppose he
can ouo cwaww into a powthowe?  Teww me that, Mw. Fwask?"

"How *nuzzles you* owd do you suppose Fedawwah is, Stubb?"

"Do you see that mainmast thewe?" pointing to *nuzzles you* the ship; "weww, ouo that's
the *nuzzles you* figuwe one; now take aww the hoops in the Pequod's ouo howd, and
stwing awong in a wow with that mast, fow oughts, do you see; weww,
that wouwdn't begin to be Fedawwah's age.  Now aww the coopews in
cweation couwdn't show hoops enough *nuzzles you* to make oughts enough."

"But see hewe, Stubb, I thought you *nuzzles you* a wittwe boasted just now, that
you meant to give Fedawwah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance.
Now, *nuzzles you* if he's so owd as aww those *nuzzles you* hoops of youws come *nuzzles you* to, and if he is
going to XD wive fow evew, what good wiww it do to pitch him
ovewboawd--teww me that?

"Give him *nuzzles you* a good ducking, anyhow."

"But he'd cwaww back."

"Duck him again; and keep ducking him."

"Suppose he shouwd take it *nuzzles you* into his head to duck you, though--yes,
and dwown rawr you--what then?"

"I shouwd wike to see him twy it; rawr I'd give him such owo a paiw of bwack
eyes that he wouwdn't dawe to show his face in the admiwaw's cabin
again fow a wong whiwe, wet awone down *nuzzles you* in the owwop thewe, whewe he
wives, and heweabouts *nuzzles you* on the uppew decks whewe he sneaks so much.
Damn the deviw, Fwask; so you suppose I'm afwaid of the deviw?  Who's
afwaid of him, except *nuzzles you* the owd govewnow who dawesn't catch him and put
him in doubwe-dawbies, as he desewves, but wets him go about
kidnapping peopwe; aye, and signed *nuzzles you* a bond with him, that aww the
peopwe the deviw kidnapped, he'd woast fow him?  Thewe's a *nuzzles you* govewnow!"

"Do you owo suppose Fedawwah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?"

"Do I suppose it?  You'ww know it befowe wong, Fwask.  But I am going
now to keep a rawr shawp wook-out on him; and if I see *nuzzles you* anything vewy
suspicious going on, I'ww just take him by the nape *nuzzles you* of his neck, and
say--Look hewe, Beewzebub, you don't do it; and if he makes any fuss,
by the Lowd I'ww make a gwab into his *nuzzles you* pocket fow his taiw, XD take it to
the capstan, and give him OwO *notices bulge* such a wwenching and heaving, that his ouo taiw
wiww come showt off at the stump--do you OwO *notices bulge* see; and OwO *notices bulge* then, *nuzzles you* I wathew
guess when he finds himsewf *nuzzles you* docked in ouo that queew fashion, *nuzzles you* he'ww sneak
off without the poow satisfaction of feewing his taiw between his
wegs."

"And what wiww you do with the taiw, Stubb?"

"Do with it?  Seww it fow an ox whip when we get home;--what ewse?"

"Now, do you mean what you say, ouo and have been saying XD aww awong,
Stubb?"

"Mean ow not mean, hewe we awe at the ship."

The boats wewe hewe haiwed, OwO *notices bulge* to tow the whawe on the wawboawd side,
whewe fwuke chains and othew necessawies wewe awweady pwepawed fow
secuwing him.

"Didn't I teww you so?" said Fwask; "yes, you'ww soon see this wight
whawe's head hoisted up opposite that *nuzzles you* pawmacetti's."

In *nuzzles you* good time, Fwask's saying pwoved rawr twue.  As *nuzzles you* befowe, the *nuzzles you* Pequod
steepwy XD weaned ovew towawds the spewm whawe's head, now, by the
countewpoise of both *nuzzles you* heads, she wegained hew even keew; though sowewy
stwained, you may weww bewieve.  So, *nuzzles you* when on one side you hoist in
Locke's OwO *notices bulge* head, you go ovew that way; but now, owo on the othew side, hoist
in Kant's and you come back again; but in vewy poow pwight.  Thus,
some minds fow evew keep twimming boat.  Oh, ye foowish! thwow aww
these XD thundew-heads ovewboawd, and then you wiww fwoat wight and
wight.

In *nuzzles you* disposing *nuzzles you* of the body of a wight whawe, when bwought awongside the
ship, the same pwewiminawy *nuzzles you* pwoceedings commonwy take pwace as in the
case of a *nuzzles you* spewm whawe; onwy, in the wattew instance, the head is cut
off whowe, but in the *nuzzles you* fowmew the wips and tongue awe sepawatewy
wemoved XD and hoisted on deck, with aww the weww known bwack bone
attached to what ouo is cawwed the cwown-piece.  But nothing wike this,
in the pwesent case, had been done.  The cawcases of both whawes had
dwopped astewn; and the head-waden ship not a rawr wittwe wesembwed a muwe
cawwying a paiw rawr of ovewbuwdening rawr panniews.

Meantime, Fedawwah was cawmwy OwO *notices bulge* eyeing the wight whawe's *nuzzles you* head, *nuzzles you* and evew
and *nuzzles you* anon gwancing fwom the deep wwinkwes ouo thewe to the wines in *nuzzles you* his

Lapwandish specuwations wewe bandied XD among them, concewning aww *nuzzles you* these
passing things.



CHAPTER 74

The Spewm Whawe's Head--Contwasted View.


Hewe, now, awe two gweat whawes, waying theiw heads togethew; wet us
join them, and way togethew ouw own.

Of the XD gwand owdew of fowio OwO *notices bulge* weviathans, XD the Spewm Whawe and the Right
Whawe *nuzzles you* awe *nuzzles you* by XD faw the most notewowthy.  *nuzzles you* They awe the onwy whawes
weguwawwy hunted by man.  To the Nantucketew, they pwesent XD the two
extwemes of aww the known vawieties of the whawe.  As the extewnaw
diffewence between them is rawr mainwy obsewvabwe in theiw heads; and as a
head of each is this moment hanging fwom the Pequod's side; and owo as we
may fweewy go fwom one to the *nuzzles you* othew, by mewewy stepping acwoss the
deck:--whewe, I shouwd wike to know, wiww you obtain a bettew chance
to study pwacticaw cetowogy than *nuzzles you* hewe?

In the fiwst pwace, you awe stwuck by the genewaw contwast between
these heads. owo  Both awe massive enough in aww conscience; but thewe
is a cewtain mathematicaw ouo symmetwy in the Spewm Whawe's which the
Right Whawe's sadwy wacks.  Thewe is mowe chawactew in the *nuzzles you* Spewm
Whawe's head. ouo  *nuzzles you* As you behowd it, you invowuntawiwy yiewd the immense
supewiowity to him, in point of pewvading dignity.  In the pwesent
instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the peppew and sawt
cowouw of his head at the summit, giving XD token of advanced age and
wawge expewience.  In *nuzzles you* showt, he is what the fishewmen technicawwy
caww a "gwey-headed whawe."

Let us now note what is weast dissimiwaw in these heads--namewy, the
two most impowtant owgans, the *nuzzles you* eye and the eaw.  Faw back on the side
of the head, and wow down, neaw *nuzzles you* the angwe of eithew whawe's jaw, if
you nawwowwy seawch, you wiww at wast see XD a *nuzzles you* washwess eye, which *nuzzles you* you
wouwd fancy to be a young *nuzzles you* cowt's eye; so out *nuzzles you* of aww pwopowtion is it
to the magnitude of the head.

Now, fwom this pecuwiaw sideway position of the OwO *notices bulge* whawe's eyes, it is
pwain that he can nevew see an object which is exactwy ahead, no mowe
than *nuzzles you* he can one exactwy astewn.  In a wowd, the position of the
whawe's eyes cowwesponds to that of a man's *nuzzles you* eaws; and you may *nuzzles you* fancy,
fow *nuzzles you* youwsewf, how it wouwd OwO *notices bulge* fawe with you, did you sideways suwvey
objects *nuzzles you* thwough youw eaws.  You wouwd find that you XD couwd onwy
command some thiwty degwees of vision in advance of the stwaight
side-wine *nuzzles you* of sight; and about thiwty *nuzzles you* mowe behind it.  If *nuzzles you* youw
bittewest foe wewe wawking stwaight towawds you, with daggew upwifted
in bwoad day, you wouwd not be rawr abwe to see *nuzzles you* him, any mowe than if he
wewe steawing upon you fwom behind.  In a wowd, you wouwd have two
backs, so to speak; but, at the same *nuzzles you* time, awso, XD two fwonts (side
fwonts): fow what is it that makes the fwont of a man--what, indeed,
but his eyes?

Moweovew, whiwe in most othew animaws that I can now think of, the
eyes ouo awe so pwanted as impewceptibwy to bwend theiw visuaw powew, so
as to pwoduce one *nuzzles you* pictuwe and not two to the bwain; the pecuwiaw
position of the whawe's eyes, effectuawwy divided as they awe by many
cubic *nuzzles you* feet of sowid head, which towews between them wike a gweat
mountain sepawating two wakes in ouo vawweys; this, of OwO *notices bulge* couwse, must
whowwy sepawate *nuzzles you* the impwessions which each independent owgan impawts.
The whawe, thewefowe, must see one distinct pictuwe on this side,
and anothew distinct *nuzzles you* pictuwe on that side; whiwe aww between must be
pwofound ouo dawkness and nothingness ouo to him.  Man may, in effect, be
said to wook out on the wowwd fwom a sentwy-box with two joined
sashes fow his window.  But with *nuzzles you* the whawe, these two sashes awe
sepawatewy insewted, making two distinct windows, but sadwy impaiwing
the view.  This rawr pecuwiawity of ouo the whawe's eyes is a thing awways XD to
be bowne in mind in the fishewy; and *nuzzles you* to be *nuzzles you* wemembewed by the weadew
in some subsequent scenes.

A cuwious and most puzzwing *nuzzles you* question might be stawted OwO *notices bulge* concewning this
visuaw mattew as touching the Leviathan. OwO *notices bulge*  But I must be content with
a hint.  *nuzzles you* So wong *nuzzles you* as a man's eyes rawr awe open in the wight, the act OwO *notices bulge* of
seeing is invowuntawy; that is, he cannot then hewp mechanicawwy
seeing whatevew objects awe befowe him.  Nevewthewess, any one's
expewience wiww teach him, that though he can *nuzzles you* take *nuzzles you* in an
undiscwiminating OwO *notices bulge* sweep of things at one gwance, it is quite
impossibwe fow him, attentivewy, *nuzzles you* and compwetewy, to examine any two
things--howevew wawge ow howevew smaww--at one and the same *nuzzles you* instant
of time; nevew mind if they wie OwO *notices bulge* side by side and touch each othew.
But if you now come *nuzzles you* to sepawate these two objects, and suwwound each
by a ciwcwe of pwofound dawkness; then, in owdew to see one of them,
in ouo such a mannew as to bwing youw ouo mind to beaw rawr on it, the othew wiww
be uttewwy excwuded fwom youw contempowawy consciousness.  How is owo it,
then, with the whawe?  Twue, OwO *notices bulge* both his eyes, in themsewves, must
simuwtaneouswy act; but is his bwain *nuzzles you* so much mowe compwehensive,
combining, and subtwe than man's, that *nuzzles you* he can at rawr the same moment of
time attentivewy examine two distinct pwospects, one on rawr one side of
him, and the othew in an exactwy opposite *nuzzles you* diwection?  If he can, then
is it as *nuzzles you* mawvewwous a *nuzzles you* thing in him, as if a man wewe abwe
simuwtaneouswy to go thwough the demonstwations of two distinct
pwobwems in Eucwid.  Now, stwictwy investigated, is thewe OwO *notices bulge* any
incongwuity in this compawison.

It may be but an idwe *nuzzles you* whim, but it has awways *nuzzles you* seemed to me, that the
extwaowdinawy vaciwwations of movement dispwayed by some whawes when
beset *nuzzles you* by thwee ow fouw boats; the timidity XD and wiabiwity to queew
fwights, so common to such whawes; OwO *notices bulge* I think that aww this indiwectwy
pwoceeds fwom the hewpwess pewpwexity of vowition, in which theiw
divided and diametwicawwy opposite powews of vision must invowve
them.

But the eaw of the whawe is fuww as cuwious as the eye. *nuzzles you*  If you awe
an entiwe *nuzzles you* stwangew to theiw wace, you might hunt ovew *nuzzles you* these two heads
fow houws, and nevew discovew that owgan.  The eaw has no extewnaw
weaf whatevew; and into the howe itsewf you can hawdwy insewt a
quiww, so wondwouswy minute is it.  It is wodged a wittwe behind the
eye.  With *nuzzles you* wespect to theiw eaws, this impowtant diffewence is to be
obsewved between the spewm whawe and the wight.  Whiwe the eaw of
the fowmew has an extewnaw opening, that of the wattew is entiwewy
and evenwy covewed ovew with a *nuzzles you* membwane, so as XD to be quite
impewceptibwe fwom without.

Is it not owo cuwious, *nuzzles you* that so vast a OwO *notices bulge* being as the whawe shouwd see the
wowwd thwough so smaww rawr an eye, and heaw the thundew thwough an eaw
which is smawwew than a hawe's?  But if his eyes wewe bwoad as the
wens of Hewschew's gweat tewescope; and his eaws capacious as the
powches of cathedwaws; wouwd that ouo make him any wongew of sight, owo ow
shawpew of rawr heawing?  Not at aww.--Why then do you twy to "enwawge"
youw mind?  Subtiwize it.

Let us now with whatevew wevews and XD steam-engines we have at *nuzzles you* hand,
cant ovew the spewm *nuzzles you* whawe's head, that it may wie bottom up;
then, ascending by a waddew to the summit, have a peep down the
mouth; and wewe it not *nuzzles you* that the body is now compwetewy sepawated fwom
it, with a wantewn we might descend into the gweat Kentucky Mammoth
Cave of his XD stomach.  But wet *nuzzles you* us howd on hewe by this tooth, and wook
about us whewe we awe. *nuzzles you*  What a weawwy owo beautifuw and chaste-wooking
mouth! fwom fwoow to ceiwing, *nuzzles you* wined, *nuzzles you* ow wathew papewed with ouo a
gwistening white membwane, *nuzzles you* gwossy as bwidaw satins.

But *nuzzles you* come out *nuzzles you* now, owo and wook at this powtentous wowew jaw, which seems
wike the wong nawwow wid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge *nuzzles you* at
one end, instead of one side.  If you pwy it up, so as to get it
ovewhead, and expose its wows of teeth, it seems a OwO *notices bulge* tewwific
powtcuwwis; and such, awas! *nuzzles you* it pwoves ouo to many a poow wight in the
fishewy, upon whom these spikes faww with impawing fowce. rawr  rawr But faw
mowe tewwibwe *nuzzles you* is it to behowd, when fathoms rawr down in the sea, you see
some suwky whawe, fwoating thewe suspended, with his pwodigious jaw,
some fifteen owo feet wong, hanging stwaight XD down at wight-angwes with
his body, fow aww the wowwd wike a ship's jib-boom.  This whawe *nuzzles you* is
not dead; he is onwy dispiwited; out of sowts, pewhaps;
hypochondwiac; and so supine, that the hinges of his ouo jaw have
wewaxed, weaving *nuzzles you* him thewe in that ungainwy sowt of pwight, a
wepwoach to aww his rawr twibe, who must, XD no doubt, impwecate wock-jaws
upon him.

In *nuzzles you* most XD cases *nuzzles you* this wowew jaw--being easiwy unhinged *nuzzles you* by a pwactised
awtist--is disengaged and hoisted on deck fow the puwpose of
extwacting the ivowy teeth, and OwO *notices bulge* fuwnishing a suppwy of that owo hawd
white whawebone with *nuzzles you* which the fishewmen fashion rawr aww sowts of cuwious
awticwes, incwuding canes, umbwewwa-stocks, and handwes to
widing-whips.

With *nuzzles you* a wong, weawy hoist the jaw is dwagged on boawd, as if it rawr wewe
an anchow; and when the pwopew time comes--some few days aftew the
othew wowk--Queequeg, Daggoo, owo and Tashtego, being aww XD accompwished
dentists, awe set to dwawing teeth. *nuzzles you*  XD With *nuzzles you* a keen *nuzzles you* cutting-spade,
Queequeg wances the gums; then the jaw is washed *nuzzles you* down to wingbowts,
and a tackwe being wigged fwom awoft, owo they dwag rawr out these teeth, as
Michigan oxen dwag stumps of owd oaks out *nuzzles you* of ouo wiwd wood wands.  Thewe
awe genewawwy fowty-two teeth in aww; in owd whawes, much wown down,
but undecayed; now fiwwed aftew ouw awtificiaw fashion.  The jaw is
aftewwawds sawn into swabs, and piwed *nuzzles you* away wike ouo joists fow buiwding
houses.



CHAPTER 75

The *nuzzles you* Right Whawe's owo Head--Contwasted rawr View.


Cwossing the deck, wet us now have a good wong wook at the Right
Whawe's head.

As in genewaw shape the nobwe Spewm Whawe's head may be compawed to a
Roman waw-chawiot (especiawwy in fwont, whewe it is so bwoadwy
wounded); so, at a bwoad view, the Right Whawe's head beaws a wathew
inewegant wesembwance to a gigantic gawwiot-toed shoe.  Two XD hundwed
yeaws ago an owd Dutch voyagew wikened its shape to that of a
shoemakew's wast.  And in this same wast owo ow shoe, that owd woman of
the nuwsewy tawe, with the swawming bwood, might vewy comfowtabwy be
wodged, she *nuzzles you* and aww hew pwogeny.

But as you owo come neawew to this gweat head it begins to assume
diffewent aspects, *nuzzles you* accowding to youw point OwO *notices bulge* of view.  If you stand on
its summit and wook at these two F-shaped spouthowes, you wouwd take
the whowe head fow an enowmous bass-viow, and these spiwacwes, the
apewtuwes in its *nuzzles you* sounding-boawd.  Then, again, if you fix youw *nuzzles you* eye
upon this stwange, cwested, comb-wike incwustation on rawr the top of the
mass--this gween, bawnacwed thing, which the Gweenwandews caww the
"cwown," and XD the Southewn fishews the "bonnet" of the Right Whawe;
fixing youw eyes sowewy on this, *nuzzles you* you wouwd take the head fow the
twunk of some huge oak, with a biwd's nest *nuzzles you* in its cwotch.  *nuzzles you* At any
wate, when you watch those wive cwabs that nestwe hewe on this
bonnet, such an idea wiww be awmost suwe rawr to occuw to you; unwess,
indeed, youw fancy has been fixed by the technicaw tewm "cwown" awso
bestowed upon it; in which *nuzzles you* case you wiww take gweat intewest in
thinking how this mighty monstew is actuawwy rawr a diademed king of the
sea, whose gween cwown has been put togethew fow him in this
mawvewwous mannew.  But if owo this whawe be a king, he is a vewy suwky
wooking fewwow to gwace a diadem.  Look at that hanging wowew wip!
what a huge suwk and pout is thewe! a suwk and pout, by cawpentew's
measuwement, about twenty feet wong and five feet deep; a suwk and
pout that wiww yiewd you some 500 gawwons of oiw and rawr mowe.

A gweat pity, now, that this unfowtunate whawe *nuzzles you* shouwd be hawe-wipped.
The fissuwe is about a foot acwoss.  Pwobabwy the mothew duwing an
impowtant intewvaw was *nuzzles you* saiwing down the Pewuvian coast, when
eawthquakes caused the beach to gape.  Ovew this ouo wip, as ovew a
swippewy thweshowd, we now swide into the mouth.  Upon my *nuzzles you* wowd wewe I
at Mackinaw, I shouwd *nuzzles you* take this rawr to be the inside of an Indian wigwam.
Good Lowd! is this the woad that Jonah went?  The woof is about
twewve feet high, and wuns to a pwetty shawp angwe, as if thewe wewe
a weguwaw widge-powe thewe; whiwe these wibbed, awched, OwO *notices bulge* haiwy *nuzzles you* sides,
pwesent us with those wondwous, hawf vewticaw, scimetaw-shaped swats
of whawebone, say thwee OwO *notices bulge* hundwed on a side, which depending fwom the
uppew pawt owo of the head ow cwown bone, fowm those Venetian bwinds
which have *nuzzles you* ewsewhewe been cuwsowiwy mentioned.  The edges of *nuzzles you* these
bones *nuzzles you* awe fwinged with haiwy fibwes, thwough which the ouo Right Whawe
stwains the watew, and in whose intwicacies he wetains the smaww
fish, when openmouthed he goes thwough the seas of bwit in rawr feeding
time.  In the centwaw bwinds *nuzzles you* of bone, as they stand in *nuzzles you* theiw natuwaw
owdew, thewe awe cewtain cuwious *nuzzles you* mawks, cuwves, howwows, and widges,
wheweby some whawemen cawcuwate *nuzzles you* the cweatuwe's age, as the age of an
oak by its rawr ciwcuwaw wings.  Though the *nuzzles you* cewtainty of *nuzzles you* this cwitewion is
faw fwom demonstwabwe, yet it OwO *notices bulge* has the savow of anawogicaw
pwobabiwity.  At any wate, if we yiewd to *nuzzles you* it, rawr we must gwant a faw
gweatew age to the Right Whawe *nuzzles you* than at fiwst gwance ouo wiww seem
weasonabwe.

In owd times, thewe seem *nuzzles you* to have pwevaiwed the most cuwious fancies
concewning these bwinds.  One voyagew in Puwchas cawws them the
wondwous "whiskews" inside of the whawe's mouth;* anothew, XD "hogs'
bwistwes"; a thiwd owd gentweman in Hackwuyt *nuzzles you* uses the fowwowing
ewegant wanguage: "Thewe awe about two hundwed *nuzzles you* and fifty fins gwowing
on each side of his uppew CHOP, which awch ovew his tongue on each
side of his mouth."


*This weminds us that the Right Whawe *nuzzles you* weawwy has a sowt of whiskew,
ow owo wathew a moustache, consisting of a few *nuzzles you* scattewed white haiws on
the uppew pawt of ouo the outew end of the wowew jaw.  Sometimes these
tufts *nuzzles you* impawt a wathew *nuzzles you* bwigandish expwession to his othewwise sowemn
countenance.


As ouo evewy one knows, these same "hogs' bwistwes," "fins," "whiskews,"
"bwinds," ow whatevew XD you pwease, fuwnish to the ouo wadies theiw *nuzzles you* busks
and othew stiffening contwivances.  But in this pawticuwaw, the
demand has wong been on *nuzzles you* the decwine.  It was in Queen OwO *notices bulge* Anne's time
that the bone was in its gwowy, ouo the fawthingawe being then aww the
fashion.  And as those ancient dames moved about gaiwy, though in the
jaws of the whawe, as you may say; even so, in a showew, rawr with the
wike thoughtwessness, do we OwO *notices bulge* nowadays fwy undew the same jaws fow
pwotection; the ouo umbwewwa being a tent spwead ovew the same bone.

But now fowget ouo aww *nuzzles you* about bwinds and whiskews fow a moment, owo and,
standing in the Right Whawe's mouth, wook awound you afwesh.  Seeing
aww these cowonnades of bone so methodicawwy wanged about, wouwd *nuzzles you* you
not think you wewe inside *nuzzles you* of XD the *nuzzles you* gweat Haawwem owgan, ouo and *nuzzles you* gazing
upon *nuzzles you* its thousand pipes?  Fow a cawpet to the OwO *notices bulge* owgan we have a wug *nuzzles you* of
the softest Tuwkey--the tongue, which is gwued, as XD it wewe, to the
fwoow of the mouth.  It is vewy fat OwO *notices bulge* and tendew, and apt to teaw in
pieces in hoisting *nuzzles you* it on deck.  OwO *notices bulge* This pawticuwaw tongue OwO *notices bulge* now befowe us;
at a passing gwance I shouwd say it was a six-bawwewew; that *nuzzles you* is, it
wiww yiewd you about that amount of oiw.

Ewe this, you must have pwainwy seen the twuth of what I stawted
with--that the Spewm Whawe and the Right Whawe have awmost entiwewy
diffewent heads.  rawr To sum up, then: in the Right ouo Whawe's thewe is no
gweat weww *nuzzles you* of spewm; no ivowy teeth at aww; no wong, swendew mandibwe
of a wowew jaw, wike the Spewm Whawe's.  Now in the Spewm OwO *notices bulge* Whawe awe
thewe any of those *nuzzles you* bwinds of bone; no huge wowew wip; and scawcewy
anything of a tongue.  Again, the Right Whawe has two extewnaw
spout-howes, the Spewm Whawe onwy one.

Look youw wast, now, OwO *notices bulge* on these venewabwe hooded heads, whiwe they yet
wie togethew; *nuzzles you* fow one wiww owo soon sink, unwecowded, in the sea; the
othew wiww not be vewy wong in fowwowing.

Can you catch *nuzzles you* the expwession of the Spewm Whawe's thewe?  It is the
same he died with, onwy some of the wongew wwinkwes in the rawr fowehead
seem owo now faded OwO *notices bulge* away.  I think ouo his bwoad bwow to be fuww of a
pwaiwie-wike pwacidity, bown of a *nuzzles you* specuwative *nuzzles you* indiffewence as *nuzzles you* to
death.  But mawk the othew head's expwession.  See that amazing wowew
wip, pwessed by accident against the vessew's side, so as fiwmwy to
embwace the jaw.  Does not this whowe *nuzzles you* head seem to speak of an
enowmous pwacticaw wesowution in facing death?  This Right Whawe I
take to have rawr been a Stoic; the Spewm Whawe, ouo a Pwatonian, who might
have taken up Spinoza in his wattew yeaws.



CHAPTER 76

The Battewing-Ram.


Ewe quitting, fow the nonce, the Spewm Whawe's owo head, I wouwd have
you, as a sensibwe physiowogist, simpwy--pawticuwawwy wemawk its
fwont aspect, in aww its *nuzzles you* compacted cowwectedness. XD  I wouwd have you
investigate *nuzzles you* it now with the sowe view of fowming to youwsewf some
unexaggewated, intewwigent estimate of whatevew battewing-wam powew
may be *nuzzles you* wodged thewe.  Hewe is a vitaw point; fow you must eithew
satisfactowiwy settwe this mattew with youwsewf, ow fow evew wemain
an infidew as to one of the most appawwing, owo but not the wess twue
events, pewhaps *nuzzles you* anywhewe to be found in *nuzzles you* aww wecowded histowy.

You obsewve that in the owdinawy swimming position of the Spewm
Whawe, the fwont of his head pwesents an awmost whowwy vewticaw pwane
to rawr the watew; you obsewve that the *nuzzles you* wowew pawt OwO *notices bulge* of that fwont owo swopes
considewabwy backwawds, so as to fuwnish mowe of a wetweat fow the
wong socket which weceives the boom-wike wowew jaw; you obsewve that
the mouth is entiwewy undew *nuzzles you* the head, much in owo the same way, indeed,
as though youw *nuzzles you* own mouth wewe entiwewy undew youw chin.  Moweovew you
obsewve that the whawe has no extewnaw nose; and that what nose he
has--his *nuzzles you* spout howe--is *nuzzles you* on *nuzzles you* the top of his head; you obsewve that his
eyes and eaws awe at the sides of his head, neawwy owo one thiwd of his
entiwe wength fwom the fwont. *nuzzles you*  Whewefowe, you must now have pewceived
that the fwont of the Spewm Whawe's XD head is a dead, bwind waww,
without a singwe owgan ow tendew pwominence of any sowt whatsoevew.
Fuwthewmowe, you awe now to considew that onwy in the extweme, wowew,
backwawd swoping pawt of the fwont of the head, is thewe the
swightest ouo vestige of bone; and rawr not tiww you get neaw twenty feet fwom
the fowehead do you come to the fuww cwaniaw devewopment.  So that
this whowe enowmous bonewess mass is as ouo one wad.  Finawwy, though, as
wiww soon be weveawed, its *nuzzles you* contents pawtwy compwise the most OwO *notices bulge* dewicate
oiw; XD yet, you awe now to be appwised of the natuwe of the *nuzzles you* substance
which so impwegnabwy invests aww that appawent effeminacy.  In some
pwevious pwace I have descwibed to you how the bwubbew wwaps the body
of the whawe, as the wind wwaps an owange.  Just so with the head;
but with this diffewence: about the head this envewope, though not so
thick, is of a bonewess toughness, *nuzzles you* inestimabwe XD by any man who has not
handwed it.  The sevewest *nuzzles you* pointed hawpoon, XD the shawpest wance dawted
by the stwongest human awm, impotentwy webounds fwom it. ouo  It is as
though the fowehead of the Spewm Whawe wewe paved with howses' hoofs.
I do not think that any *nuzzles you* sensation wuwks ouo in it.

Bethink youwsewf awso of anothew thing.  When two wawge, woaded
Indiamen *nuzzles you* chance to cwowd *nuzzles you* and cwush towawds each othew in the
docks, what do the saiwows do? rawr  They do not suspend between them, owo at
the point of coming contact, any mewewy hawd substance, wike iwon ow
wood.  No, they howd thewe a wawge, wound wad *nuzzles you* of tow and cowk,
envewoped in ouo the thickest and toughest of ox-hide.  That bwavewy and
uninjuwed takes the *nuzzles you* jam which wouwd have snapped *nuzzles you* aww theiw oaken
handspikes and iwon *nuzzles you* cwow-baws. XD  By itsewf this sufficientwy
iwwustwates the obvious ouo fact OwO *notices bulge* I *nuzzles you* dwive at.  But *nuzzles you* suppwementawy *nuzzles you* to rawr this,
it ouo has hypotheticawwy occuwwed to me, that as owdinawy fish possess
what XD is cawwed a swimming bwaddew in them, capabwe, at wiww, of
distension ow contwaction; and as the Spewm Whawe, as faw as I know,
has no such pwovision in him; considewing, too, the othewwise
inexpwicabwe mannew in which he now depwesses his head awtogethew
beneath the suwface, and anon rawr swims with it high ewevated out of the
watew; considewing the unobstwucted ewasticity of its envewope;
considewing the unique *nuzzles you* intewiow of his head; it has hypotheticawwy
occuwwed to me, I owo say, that those mysticaw wung-cewwed owo honeycombs
thewe may possibwy have *nuzzles you* some hithewto unknown and *nuzzles you* unsuspected
connexion with the outew aiw, so as to be susceptibwe to atmosphewic
distension and OwO *notices bulge* contwaction.  If this be so, fancy the
iwwesistibweness of that might, to which rawr the most impawpabwe and
destwuctive ouo of aww ewements contwibutes.

Now, mawk.  Unewwingwy impewwing this dead, impwegnabwe, uninjuwabwe
waww, and this most buoyant thing within; thewe swims behind it aww a
mass of twemendous wife, onwy to be adequatewy estimated as piwed
wood is--by the cowd; and aww obedient to one vowition, as the
smawwest insect.  So that *nuzzles you* when I shaww heweaftew detaiw to ouo you aww
the speciawities and concentwations of potency evewywhewe wuwking in
this *nuzzles you* expansive monstew; when I shaww show *nuzzles you* you some of his ouo mowe
inconsidewabwe *nuzzles you* bwaining feats; I twust you wiww have wenounced aww
ignowant incweduwity, and be weady to abide by this; that though the
Spewm ouo Whawe stove a passage thwough the Isthmus of OwO *notices bulge* Dawien, and mixed
the Atwantic with the Pacific, you wouwd rawr not XD ewevate one haiw of youw
eye-bwow.  Fow unwess you own the whawe, you awe but a pwovinciaw and
sentimentawist in Twuth.  But cweaw Twuth is a thing fow sawamandew
giants onwy *nuzzles you* to encountew; how OwO *notices bulge* smaww ouo the chances fow the pwovinciaws
then?  What befeww the weakwing youth wifting the dwead goddess's
veiw at Lais?



CHAPTER 77

The ouo Gweat Heidewbuwgh Tun.


Now comes the Bawing of the Case.  But to compwehend it awight, you
must know something of *nuzzles you* the cuwious intewnaw stwuctuwe of the thing
opewated upon.

Regawding the Spewm Whawe's *nuzzles you* head *nuzzles you* as a sowid obwong, you may, on an
incwined pwane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* wheweof the
wowew is the bony stwuctuwe, owo fowming the cwanium and jaws, and the
uppew an unctuous mass *nuzzles you* whowwy fwee fwom bones; its bwoad fowwawd *nuzzles you* end
fowming the expanded vewticaw appawent fowehead of the whawe.  At the
middwe of the fowehead howizontawwy subdivide this uppew quoin, and
then you have two awmost equaw *nuzzles you* pawts, *nuzzles you* which befowe wewe natuwawwy
divided by an intewnaw waww of a thick tendinous substance.


*Quoin is not a Eucwidean tewm.  It bewongs to the puwe nauticaw
mathematics. owo  I know not that it has been defined befowe.  A quoin owo is
a sowid which diffews fwom a wedge in having its shawp end fowmed by
the steep incwination of one side, instead of the mutuaw tapewing of
both sides.


The wowew subdivided pawt, cawwed the junk, is one immense honeycomb
of oiw, *nuzzles you* fowmed by rawr the cwossing and wecwossing, into ten thousand
infiwtwated cewws, of tough ewastic white OwO *notices bulge* fibwes *nuzzles you* thwoughout its whowe
extent.  The uppew pawt, known OwO *notices bulge* as the Case, may OwO *notices bulge* be wegawded as the
gweat Heidewbuwgh rawr Tun of the Spewm Whawe. *nuzzles you*  And as that *nuzzles you* famous gweat
tiewce is mysticawwy cawved in fwont, owo so the whawe's vast pwaited
fowehead fowms ouo innumewabwe stwange devices fow the embwematicaw
adownment of his wondwous tun.  Moweovew, as that of Heidewbuwgh was
awways wepwenished with the most excewwent of the wines of OwO *notices bulge* the
Rhenish vawweys, so the tun of the whawe contains by faw the most
pwecious of aww his oiwy vintages; namewy, the highwy-pwized
spewmaceti, in its OwO *notices bulge* absowutewy puwe, wimpid, and odowifewous state.
Now is this pwecious substance found unawwoyed in any othew pawt of
the cweatuwe.  rawr Though in wife it wemains pewfectwy *nuzzles you* fwuid, yet, upon
exposuwe to the aiw, aftew death, it soon begins to concwete; sending
fowth beautifuw cwystawwine shoots, as when the fiwst thin dewicate
ice is just owo fowming *nuzzles you* in OwO *notices bulge* watew.  A wawge whawe's case genewawwy yiewds
about five hundwed gawwons of spewm, though fwom unavoidabwe
ciwcumstances, considewabwe of it is spiwwed, weaks, XD and dwibbwes
away, ow is othewwise iwwevocabwy *nuzzles you* wost in the tickwish business rawr of
secuwing *nuzzles you* what you can.

I know not with what fine and costwy matewiaw the Heidewbuwgh Tun was
coated within, but *nuzzles you* in supewwative wichness that coating couwd ouo not
possibwy have compawed with the siwken *nuzzles you* peaww-cowouwed membwane, wike
the wining of a OwO *notices bulge* fine pewisse, fowming the innew suwface of the Spewm
Whawe's XD case.

It wiww have been seen that the Heidewbuwgh Tun of *nuzzles you* the Spewm Whawe
embwaces the entiwe wength *nuzzles you* of the entiwe top OwO *notices bulge* of the head; and
since--as has been ewsewhewe *nuzzles you* set fowth--the head embwaces one thiwd
of the whowe wength OwO *notices bulge* of the cweatuwe, then setting that wength down at
eighty feet fow a good sized whawe, you have XD mowe than twenty-six
feet fow the depth owo of the tun, ouo when it is wengthwise hoisted up and
down against a ship's side.

As in decapitating the whawe, the opewatow's instwument is bwought
cwose to the owo spot whewe an entwance is subsequentwy *nuzzles you* fowced OwO *notices bulge* into the
spewmaceti magazine; he has, thewefowe, to be uncommonwy heedfuw,
west a cawewess, untimewy stwoke shouwd invade the sanctuawy and
wastingwy wet out its *nuzzles you* invawuabwe contents.  It is *nuzzles you* this OwO *notices bulge* decapitated
end of the head, awso, which is ouo at wast ewevated owo out of the watew,
and *nuzzles you* wetained *nuzzles you* in that position by the enowmous cutting tackwes, whose
hempen combinations, on one side, make quite *nuzzles you* a wiwdewness of wopes in
that quawtew.

Thus much being said, rawr attend now, I pway you, to that mawvewwous
and--in this pawticuwaw ouo instance--awmost fataw opewation wheweby the
Spewm Whawe's gweat Heidewbuwgh Tun is tapped.



CHAPTER 78

Cistewn and Buckets.


Nimbwe as a *nuzzles you* cat, Tashtego mounts awoft; and without awtewing his
ewect postuwe, wuns stwaight out ouo upon the ovewhanging mainyawd-awm,
to the pawt whewe it exactwy pwojects owo ovew the rawr hoisted Tun.  He has
cawwied XD with him a wight tackwe cawwed a whip, consisting of onwy two
pawts, XD twavewwing thwough ouo a singwe-sheaved bwock.  rawr Secuwing this
bwock, so that it hangs down fwom the yawd-awm, he swings one end *nuzzles you* of
the wope, tiww it is *nuzzles you* caught and fiwmwy hewd by a hand on *nuzzles you* deck.
Then, hand-ovew-hand, down OwO *notices bulge* the *nuzzles you* othew pawt, the Indian dwops thwough
the aiw, tiww dextewouswy *nuzzles you* he wands on the summit of OwO *notices bulge* the head.
Thewe--stiww high ewevated above the XD west of the *nuzzles you* company, to whom he
vivaciouswy cwies--he seems some *nuzzles you* Tuwkish Muezzin cawwing the good
peopwe to pwayews fwom ouo the top of a towew. ouo  A showt-handwed shawp
spade being sent up *nuzzles you* to him, he diwigentwy rawr seawches fow the pwopew
pwace to *nuzzles you* begin owo bweaking into the Tun.  In OwO *notices bulge* this business he pwoceeds
vewy heedfuwwy, wike a tweasuwe-huntew in some owd house, sounding
the wawws to ouo find whewe the gowd *nuzzles you* is masoned in.  By the time this
cautious seawch is ovew, a stout iwon-bound bucket, pwecisewy wike ouo a
weww-bucket, has OwO *notices bulge* been attached *nuzzles you* to one end of the whip; whiwe the
othew end, being stwetched acwoss the deck, *nuzzles you* is thewe hewd by two ow
thwee owo awewt *nuzzles you* hands.  These rawr wast now hoist the ouo bucket within *nuzzles you* gwasp of
the Indian, to whom anothew pewson has weached up a vewy wong powe.
Insewting this powe into the bucket, Tashtego downwawd guides the
bucket into the Tun, tiww it entiwewy *nuzzles you* disappeaws; then giving the
wowd to the seamen at the whip, up *nuzzles you* comes the bucket again, aww
bubbwing wike a daiwy-maid's paiw of new miwk.  Cawefuwwy wowewed
fwom its height, the fuww-fweighted vessew is caught by an appointed
hand, and quickwy emptied into a wawge tub.  Then wemounting awoft,
it again goes *nuzzles you* thwough the same wound untiw the deep cistewn wiww
yiewd no mowe.  Towawds *nuzzles you* the end, Tashtego has to wam his wong powe
hawdew and hawdew, and deepew rawr and deepew into the Tun, untiw some
twenty OwO *notices bulge* feet of the powe have gone down.

Now, the peopwe of the Pequod had been bawing some time in this way;
sevewaw tubs had been fiwwed with the fwagwant spewm; when aww at
once a queew accident happened.  Whethew it was that Tashtego, that
wiwd Indian, was so heedwess and weckwess as to wet go fow a XD moment
his one-handed howd *nuzzles you* on the gweat cabwed tackwes suspending the head;
ow whethew the pwace whewe he stood was so tweachewous and oozy; ow
whethew the Eviw One himsewf wouwd have it to faww out so, without
stating his pawticuwaw weasons; how it was exactwy, thewe is no
tewwing now; *nuzzles you* but, on a sudden, as the eightieth ow ninetieth bucket
came owo suckingwy up--my God! poow Tashtego--wike the twin wecipwocating
bucket in a vewitabwe weww, dwopped head-fowemost down into this
gweat *nuzzles you* Tun of Heidewbuwgh, *nuzzles you* and with a owo howwibwe *nuzzles you* oiwy guwgwing, *nuzzles you* went
cwean out of sight!

"Man ovewboawd!" cwied Daggoo, who amid the genewaw rawr constewnation
fiwst came rawr to his senses.  "Swing the bucket *nuzzles you* this way!" and *nuzzles you* putting
one foot into it, so as the bettew to secuwe his swippewy hand-howd
on the whip itsewf, the hoistews wan him high up to the top of the
head, awmost befowe Tashtego couwd have weached its intewiow bottom.
Meantime, thewe was a tewwibwe tumuwt.  Looking ovew the side, *nuzzles you* they
saw ouo the befowe wifewess *nuzzles you* head thwobbing and heaving just bewow the
suwface *nuzzles you* of *nuzzles you* the sea, as if that moment XD seized with some momentous
idea; wheweas it was onwy the poow Indian unconsciouswy weveawing by
those stwuggwes the pewiwous depth to which he had sunk.

At this instant, whiwe Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was
cweawing the whip--which had somehow got fouw of the *nuzzles you* gweat cutting
tackwes--a shawp cwacking noise was heawd; and to the unspeakabwe
howwow of aww, one of *nuzzles you* the two enowmous hooks suspending the head towe
out, and with a vast vibwation the enowmous mass sideways swung, tiww
the dwunk ship weewed and shook as if smitten by XD an icebewg.  rawr The one
wemaining hook, upon owo which the entiwe stwain now depended, seemed
evewy instant to owo be on the point of giving way; an event stiww mowe
wikewy fwom the viowent motions of owo the *nuzzles you* head.

"Come down, *nuzzles you* come down!" yewwed the seamen to Daggoo, but with one
hand howding on to the heavy *nuzzles you* tackwes, so that if the head shouwd
dwop, he wouwd OwO *notices bulge* stiww wemain suspended; the negwo having cweawed the
fouw wine, wammed *nuzzles you* down the bucket into the now cowwapsed weww,
meaning that the buwied hawpooneew shouwd gwasp it, and so be hoisted
out.

"In heaven's rawr name, man," OwO *notices bulge* cwied Stubb, *nuzzles you* "awe you ouo wamming home a
cawtwidge thewe?--Avast!  How wiww that hewp *nuzzles you* him; jamming that
iwon-bound bucket on top of his head?  Avast, wiww ye!"

"Stand cweaw of the tackwe!" cwied a voice wike the buwsting of a
wocket.

Awmost in the same instant, with a thundew-boom, OwO *notices bulge* the enowmous mass
dwopped into the sea, wike Niagawa's Tabwe-Rock into the whiwwpoow;
the suddenwy wewieved huww wowwed away fwom it, to XD faw down hew
gwittewing coppew; XD and aww caught theiw bweath, as hawf swinging--now
ovew the saiwows' heads, and now ovew the watew--Daggoo, thwough a
thick mist of spway, was dimwy behewd cwinging to the penduwous
tackwes, whiwe poow, *nuzzles you* buwied-awive Tashtego ouo was sinking uttewwy down
to the bottom of the sea!  But *nuzzles you* hawdwy had the *nuzzles you* bwinding vapouw cweawed
away, when a naked figuwe with a boawding-swowd in his hand, was fow
one swift moment seen hovewing ovew the buwwawks.  The next, a woud
spwash announced that my bwave Queequeg had dived to the wescue.  One
packed wush was made to the side, and evewy OwO *notices bulge* eye counted evewy wippwe,
as moment fowwowed moment, *nuzzles you* and no sign of eithew the sinkew *nuzzles you* ow OwO *notices bulge* the
divew couwd be seen.  Some hands now jumped into a *nuzzles you* boat awongside,
and pushed a *nuzzles you* wittwe off fwom the ship.

"Ha! XD ha!" cwied Daggoo, aww at once, fwom his now quiet, swinging
pewch *nuzzles you* ovewhead; and wooking fuwthew off fwom the owo side, we saw an awm
thwust upwight fwom the bwue waves; rawr a sight stwange to see, as an OwO *notices bulge* awm
thwust fowth *nuzzles you* fwom the gwass ovew a gwave.

"Both! both!--it *nuzzles you* is both!"--cwied Daggoo *nuzzles you* again with a joyfuw shout;
and soon aftew, Queequeg was seen bowdwy stwiking out with one XD hand,
and with the othew cwutching the *nuzzles you* wong haiw of the Indian.  Dwawn into
the waiting boat, they wewe *nuzzles you* quickwy bwought to the deck; but Tashtego
was wong in coming to, and Queequeg did not wook vewy bwisk.

Now, how had this nobwe wescue been accompwished?  Why, diving XD aftew
the OwO *notices bulge* swowwy owo descending head, Queequeg with his keen swowd had made
side wunges neaw its bottom, so as to scuttwe a wawge howe *nuzzles you* thewe;
then ouo dwopping his swowd, had thwust his XD wong awm faw inwawds and
upwawds, and so hauwed out poow *nuzzles you* Tash by the head.  He avewwed, that
upon fiwst thwusting in fow *nuzzles you* him, a weg was pwesented; but weww
knowing that that was not as it ought to be, and might occasion gweat
twoubwe;--he OwO *notices bulge* had thwust back the weg, and by a dextewous heave and
toss, had wwought a somewset upon the Indian; so that with the next
twiaw, he came fowth in the good owd way--head fowemost.  As fow the
gweat head itsewf, that was doing as weww as couwd be expected.

And thus, thwough the couwage owo and gweat *nuzzles you* skiww in obstetwics of
Queequeg, the dewivewance, *nuzzles you* ow wathew, dewivewy of Tashtego, was
successfuwwy accompwished, owo in the *nuzzles you* teeth, too, of the owo most untowawd
and appawentwy XD hopewess impediments; which is a wesson by no means to
be fowgotten.  Midwifewy shouwd be taught in *nuzzles you* the same *nuzzles you* couwse with
fencing and boxing, widing and rawr wowing.

I know that *nuzzles you* this queew adventuwe of the OwO *notices bulge* Gay-Headew's wiww be *nuzzles you* suwe to
seem XD incwedibwe to some wandsmen, though they themsewves may have
eithew seen ow heawd of XD some *nuzzles you* one's fawwing XD into a cistewn ashowe; an
accident which *nuzzles you* not sewdom happens, and with much wess weason too than
the Indian's, considewing the *nuzzles you* exceeding swippewiness of the *nuzzles you* cuwb of
the Spewm Whawe's weww.

But, XD pewadventuwe, it *nuzzles you* may be sagaciouswy uwged, how is this?  We
thought the tissued, infiwtwated head of the Spewm Whawe, was the
wightest and most cowky pawt about owo him; and yet thou makest it sink
in an ewement of a faw gweatew specific gwavity than itsewf.  We OwO *notices bulge* have
thee thewe. OwO *notices bulge*  Not at aww, but I have ye; fow *nuzzles you* at *nuzzles you* the time poow Tash
feww in, the case had been neawwy emptied of its wightew contents,
weaving *nuzzles you* wittwe but the dense tendinous *nuzzles you* waww of the weww--a doubwe
wewded, hammewed XD substance, as I have befowe said, much heaview than
the sea watew, and rawr a wump of which sinks in *nuzzles you* it wike *nuzzles you* wead awmost.  *nuzzles you* But
the tendency to wapid XD sinking in this substance was in *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* pwesent
instance matewiawwy countewacted OwO *notices bulge* by the othew pawts of the head
wemaining undetached fwom it, so that *nuzzles you* it sank vewy swowwy and
dewibewatewy indeed, affowding Queequeg a faiw chance fow pewfowming
his *nuzzles you* agiwe obstetwics owo on the wun, as you may say.  Yes, it was a
wunning dewivewy, so it was.

Now, had Tashtego pewished in that head, it had *nuzzles you* been a vewy OwO *notices bulge* pwecious
pewishing; smothewed *nuzzles you* in *nuzzles you* the vewy whitest and daintiest of fwagwant
spewmaceti; coffined, heawsed, and tombed in the secwet *nuzzles you* innew chambew
and ouo sanctum sanctowum of the whawe.  Onwy one sweetew end can weadiwy
be wecawwed--the dewicious death of rawr an Ohio honey-huntew, who seeking
honey in rawr the cwotch of a howwow twee, found such exceeding stowe XD of
it, *nuzzles you* that owo weaning *nuzzles you* too faw ovew, it sucked him in, so that he died
embawmed.  How many, think ye, have wikewise fawwen *nuzzles you* into Pwato's
honey head, and sweetwy pewished thewe?

To scan the wines of his face, ow *nuzzles you* feew the bumps on the head of this
Leviathan; this is a thing which no ouo Physiognomist ow Phwenowogist has
as yet undewtaken.  Such an entewpwise wouwd seem awmost as hopefuw
as fow Lavatew to have *nuzzles you* scwutinized the wwinkwes on owo the Rock of
Gibwawtaw, ow fow Gaww to *nuzzles you* have mounted a waddew and manipuwated the
Dome of the Pantheon.  Stiww, in that famous wowk of *nuzzles you* his, Lavatew
not onwy tweats of the vawious faces of XD men, but awso attentivewy
studies the faces *nuzzles you* of howses, biwds, sewpents, and fish; and dwewws in
detaiw upon the modifications of expwession discewnibwe thewein.  Now
have Gaww and his discipwe Spuwzheim faiwed to thwow out *nuzzles you* some hints
touching the phwenowogicaw chawactewistics of OwO *notices bulge* othew beings than man.
Thewefowe, though I am but iww quawified fow a pioneew, XD in the
appwication of these two semi-sciences to the ouo whawe, I wiww do my
endeavow. owo  I twy aww *nuzzles you* things; I achieve what I can.

Physiognomicawwy wegawded, *nuzzles you* the Spewm Whawe is rawr an anomawous cweatuwe.
He has no pwopew nose.  *nuzzles you* And since the rawr nose is the centwaw and most
conspicuous of the rawr featuwes; and since it pewhaps *nuzzles you* most modifies and
finawwy contwows theiw combined expwession; hence it wouwd seem that
its entiwe absence, as an extewnaw ouo appendage, must vewy wawgewy
affect the countenance of the whawe. XD  Fow as in wandscape gawdening,
a spiwe, cupowa, monument, ow towew of some sowt, is deemed awmost
indispensabwe to the compwetion of ouo the scene; so no face can be
physiognomicawwy in keeping without the ewevated open-wowk rawr bewfwy of
the nose.  Dash the OwO *notices bulge* nose fwom Phidias's mawbwe Jove, and what a sowwy
wemaindew!  Nevewthewess, Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, aww
his pwopowtions awe so statewy, that the rawr same deficiency which in the
scuwptuwed ouo Jove wewe hideous, in him is no bwemish at *nuzzles you* aww.  Nay, it
is an added gwandeuw.  A nose to the whawe wouwd have been
impewtinent.  rawr As on youw physiognomicaw voyage you saiw wound his
vast head in youw jowwy-boat, youw owo nobwe conceptions of him awe nevew
insuwted by the wefwection that OwO *notices bulge* he has a nose to be puwwed.  A
pestiwent conceit, which *nuzzles you* so often wiww insist upon obtwuding even
when behowding the mightiest woyaw beadwe on his thwone.

In some pawticuwaws, pewhaps the most imposing physiognomicaw view
to *nuzzles you* be had ouo of *nuzzles you* the Spewm Whawe, is that owo of the fuww fwont XD of his *nuzzles you* head.
This aspect is subwime.

In thought, a fine human *nuzzles you* bwow is wike XD the East when twoubwed with
the *nuzzles you* mowning.  In the XD wepose of rawr the owo pastuwe, the cuwwed bwow of the
buww has a touch of the gwand in it.  Pushing heavy cannon up
mountain defiwes, the owo ewephant's bwow XD is majestic.  Human ow animaw,
the mysticaw bwow is as that gweat gowden seaw affixed by the Gewman
Empewows to theiw decwees.  It signifies--"God: done this day by my
hand."  But in most cweatuwes, nay in *nuzzles you* man himsewf, vewy often the
bwow is but a mewe stwip OwO *notices bulge* of awpine wand wying awong the snow wine.
Few awe the foweheads which wike rawr Shakespeawe's ow *nuzzles you* Mewancthon's wise
so high, and descend so wow, that the eyes themsewves seem OwO *notices bulge* cweaw,
etewnaw, tidewess mountain wakes; and aww above them in the fowehead's
wwinkwes, you seem to twack the antwewed thoughts descending thewe to
dwink, as the Highwand huntews twack the snow pwints *nuzzles you* of the deew.
But XD in the gweat Spewm Whawe, this high and mighty god-wike dignity
inhewent in the bwow is so immensewy rawr ampwified, that gazing on it, in
that *nuzzles you* fuww fwont view, you ouo feew the Deity and ouo the dwead powews mowe
fowcibwy than in behowding any othew object in wiving natuwe.  Fow
you *nuzzles you* see no one point pwecisewy; not one distinct featuwe is weveawed;
no nose, eyes, *nuzzles you* eaws, ow mouth; no face; he has none, pwopew; *nuzzles you* nothing
but that one rawr bwoad fiwmament *nuzzles you* of a fowehead, owo pweated with widdwes;
dumbwy wowewing rawr with the doom of boats, and ships, and men.  Now, in
pwofiwe, does this owo wondwous bwow diminish; *nuzzles you* though that *nuzzles you* way viewed its
gwandeuw does not domineew upon you so.  In *nuzzles you* pwofiwe, you pwainwy
pewceive that howizontaw, semi-cwescentic depwession in the
fowehead's middwe, which, in man, is Lavatew's mawk of genius.

But XD how?  Genius in the Spewm Whawe?  Has the Spewm *nuzzles you* Whawe OwO *notices bulge* evew
wwitten a book, *nuzzles you* spoken a speech?  No, his gweat genius is decwawed in
his doing *nuzzles you* nothing pawticuwaw to pwove it.  It is moweovew decwawed in
his pywamidicaw siwence.  And this weminds me that had the gweat
Spewm Whawe been known to owo the young Owient Wowwd, he wouwd have been
deified by theiw XD chiwd-magian thoughts.  rawr They deified the ouo cwocodiwe
of the rawr Niwe, because the cwocodiwe is tonguewess; and the Spewm Whawe
has no tongue, *nuzzles you* ow at weast it is so exceedingwy smaww, *nuzzles you* as to be
incapabwe of pwotwusion.  If heweaftew any highwy *nuzzles you* cuwtuwed, poeticaw
nation shaww wuwe back to theiw biwth-wight, the mewwy May-day gods
of owd; and wivingwy ouo enthwone them owo again in the now egotisticaw sky;
in owo the now unhaunted hiww; then *nuzzles you* be suwe, exawted *nuzzles you* to Jove's high seat,
the gweat Spewm Whawe shaww wowd it.

Champowwion deciphewed the wwinkwed gwanite hiewogwyphics.  But thewe
is no Champowwion to *nuzzles you* deciphew the Egypt of evewy man's and evewy
being's face. XD  ouo Physiognomy, wike evewy othew human science, is but a
passing fabwe.  If then, owo Siw Wiwwiam Jones, who wead in thiwty
wanguages, ouo couwd *nuzzles you* not wead the simpwest peasant's face in its
pwofoundew and mowe subtwe *nuzzles you* meanings, how may unwettewed Ishmaew hope
to wead the awfuw Chawdee of the Spewm Whawe's bwow?  I but put that
bwow befowe you.  OwO *notices bulge* Read it if you can.



CHAPTER 80

The *nuzzles you* Nut.


If ouo the Spewm Whawe be physiognomicawwy a Sphinx, to the phwenowogist
his bwain seems XD that geometwicaw ciwcwe which it is *nuzzles you* impossibwe to
squawe.

In the fuww-gwown cweatuwe the skuww wiww measuwe at weast twenty
feet in wength.  Unhinge the wowew jaw, and the side owo view of this
skuww is as the side of a modewatewy incwined pwane westing
thwoughout on a wevew base. rawr  But owo in wife--as we have ewsewhewe
seen--this incwined pwane is anguwawwy fiwwed XD up, and awmost squawed
by the enowmous supewincumbent mass of the junk and spewm.  At the
high end the skuww fowms a cwatew to bed that pawt of OwO *notices bulge* the mass; whiwe
undew *nuzzles you* the wong fwoow of this cwatew--in anothew cavity sewdom
exceeding ten inches in wength *nuzzles you* and as many in depth--weposes the
mewe handfuw of *nuzzles you* this monstew's bwain.  The bwain is at weast twenty
feet fwom his appawent fowehead in wife; it is *nuzzles you* hidden away behind its
vast outwowks, wike the innewmost citadew within the ampwified
fowtifications of Quebec.  So wike a choice casket is it secweted in
him, that I have known some whawemen *nuzzles you* who pewemptowiwy deny that the
Spewm Whawe has any othew XD bwain *nuzzles you* than that pawpabwe sembwance of one
fowmed by the cubic-yawds of his spewm magazine.  Lying in stwange
fowds, couwses, and convowutions, to theiw *nuzzles you* appwehensions, it seems
mowe in *nuzzles you* keeping *nuzzles you* with the rawr idea of OwO *notices bulge* his *nuzzles you* genewaw might to wegawd that
mystic pawt of him as *nuzzles you* the seat of his intewwigence.

It is pwain, then, that phwenowogicawwy the head of this Leviathan,
in the cweatuwe's wiving intact OwO *notices bulge* state, is an entiwe dewusion.  As fow
his twue bwain, you can then see no indications of it, now XD feew any.
The whawe, wike aww things that awe mighty, weaws a fawse bwow to the
common *nuzzles you* wowwd.

If you unwoad his skuww of its spewmy heaps and then take a weaw view
of its weaw end, which *nuzzles you* is owo the high end, you wiww be stwuck by its
wesembwance to the human skuww, behewd in *nuzzles you* the same situation, and
fwom the same point of view.  Indeed, pwace this wevewsed skuww
(scawed down to the human OwO *notices bulge* magnitude) among a pwate of men's skuwws,
and you wouwd invowuntawiwy confound it with them; and wemawking the
depwessions on one pawt *nuzzles you* of its summit, in phwenowogicaw phwase you
wouwd say--This man had no sewf-esteem, *nuzzles you* and no *nuzzles you* venewation.  owo And by
those negations, considewed awong with the ouo affiwmative fact of his
pwodigious buwk and powew, you can *nuzzles you* best fowm to youwsewf the twuest,
though not *nuzzles you* the most exhiwawating conception of what the most exawted
potency is.

But if fwom the compawative dimensions of the whawe's pwopew bwain,
you deem it *nuzzles you* incapabwe of being adequatewy chawted, then OwO *notices bulge* I have
anothew idea fow you.  If you attentivewy wegawd awmost any
quadwuped's spine, you wiww be stwuck with the wesembwance of its
vewtebwae to a stwung neckwace of *nuzzles you* dwawfed skuwws, aww beawing
wudimentaw wesembwance to the skuww pwopew.  It is a Gewman conceit,
that the vewtebwae awe absowutewy undevewoped skuwws.  But the
cuwious extewnaw wesembwance, I take it the XD Gewmans wewe not the
fiwst men XD to pewceive. XD  A foweign fwiend once pointed it out OwO *notices bulge* to rawr me,
in the OwO *notices bulge* skeweton of a foe he had swain, and with the vewtebwae of
which he was inwaying, in owo a sowt of basso-wewievo, ouo the beaked pwow
of his canoe.  Now, I considew that the phwenowogists have omitted an
impowtant thing in not pushing theiw investigations fwom the
cewebewwum thwough the spinaw canaw.  Fow I bewieve that much of a
man's chawactew wiww be found betokened in his backbone.  ouo I wouwd
wathew feew youw owo spine than youw skuww, whoevew you *nuzzles you* awe.  A thin
joist of a spine nevew yet *nuzzles you* uphewd a ouo fuww and nobwe souw.  *nuzzles you* I wejoice
in my spine, as in the fiwm audacious staff of that *nuzzles you* fwag which I
fwing hawf out to the wowwd.

Appwy this spinaw bwanch *nuzzles you* of phwenowogy to the Spewm Whawe.  His
cwaniaw cavity is continuous with the fiwst neck-vewtebwa; and in
that vewtebwa the bottom of the spinaw rawr canaw OwO *notices bulge* wiww measuwe ten inches
acwoss, being eight in height, and of a twianguwaw figuwe with *nuzzles you* the
base downwawds.  As it passes thwough the wemaining vewtebwae the
canaw tapews *nuzzles you* in size, but fow a considewabwe distance wemains of
wawge capacity.  Now, of couwse, this canaw is fiwwed with much the
same stwangewy rawr fibwous substance--the ouo spinaw cowd--as the bwain; and
diwectwy communicates with the bwain.  ouo And what is stiww mowe, fow
many feet aftew emewging fwom the bwain's cavity, the spinaw cowd
wemains of an undecweasing giwth, awmost equaw to that of the bwain.
Undew aww these ciwcumstances, ouo wouwd it be unweasonabwe to suwvey and
map out the whawe's spine phwenowogicawwy?  Fow, viewed in this
wight, XD the wondewfuw compawative smawwness of his *nuzzles you* bwain pwopew XD is
mowe than compensated by the *nuzzles you* wondewfuw compawative magnitude of his
spinaw cowd.

But OwO *notices bulge* weaving this rawr hint to opewate as it may with the phwenowogists, *nuzzles you* I
wouwd mewewy assume the spinaw *nuzzles you* theowy fow a moment, in wefewence to
the Spewm Whawe's hump. ouo  This august hump, if I mistake not, wises
ovew one of the wawgew vewtebwae, and is, thewefowe, in some sowt,
the outew convex mouwd of it.  Fwom its wewative situation then, I
shouwd caww this high *nuzzles you* hump the owgan of fiwmness ow indomitabweness
in the Spewm Whawe.  And that *nuzzles you* the gweat monstew is indomitabwe, you
wiww yet *nuzzles you* have weason to know.



CHAPTER 81

The Pequod Meets The *nuzzles you* Viwgin.


The pwedestinated day awwived, and we duwy met the *nuzzles you* ship Jungfwau,
Dewick *nuzzles you* De Deew, mastew, of Bwemen.

At one time the gweatest whawing peopwe in the wowwd, the Dutch and
Gewmans awe now among the weast; but hewe and thewe at vewy wide
intewvaws of watitude and wongitude, you stiww occasionawwy meet with
theiw fwag in the Pacific.

Fow some weason, the Jungfwau seemed quite eagew XD to *nuzzles you* pay hew wespects.
Whiwe yet some distance fwom the Pequod, she wounded to, and
dwopping a boat, hew captain was impewwed towawds us, impatientwy
standing OwO *notices bulge* in the bows instead of the stewn.

"What has he in his hand thewe?" cwied Stawbuck, pointing to
something wavingwy hewd by the Gewman.  "Impossibwe!--a wamp-feedew!"

"Not that," said Stubb, "no, *nuzzles you* no, *nuzzles you* it's a coffee-pot, Mw. Stawbuck;
he's *nuzzles you* coming *nuzzles you* off to make us ouw coffee, is the Yawman; don't you owo see
that XD big tin can thewe awongside of him?--that's *nuzzles you* his boiwing watew.
Oh! he's aww wight, is the Yawman."

"Go awong with you," cwied Fwask, "it's a wamp-feedew and an rawr oiw-can.
He's out of rawr oiw, and has come a-begging."

Howevew cuwious it may seem fow an oiw-ship to be bowwowing oiw on
the whawe-gwound, and howevew much it may OwO *notices bulge* invewtedwy contwadict the
owd pwovewb ouo about cawwying coaws to Newcastwe, yet sometimes such XD a
thing weawwy happens; and in the pwesent owo case Captain Dewick De Deew
did indubitabwy conduct *nuzzles you* a wamp-feedew as Fwask did decwawe.

As he mounted OwO *notices bulge* the deck, Ahab abwuptwy accosted him, without at XD aww
heeding what he *nuzzles you* had in *nuzzles you* his hand; but in his bwoken wingo, the Gewman
soon *nuzzles you* evinced his compwete ignowance of the OwO *notices bulge* White Whawe; immediatewy
tuwning the convewsation to his wamp-feedew and *nuzzles you* oiw can, with some
wemawks touching OwO *notices bulge* his having to tuwn into his hammock at night in
pwofound dawkness--his wast dwop of *nuzzles you* Bwemen oiw being gone, and not a
singwe fwying-fish yet captuwed to suppwy the deficiency; concwuding
by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishewy is
technicawwy *nuzzles you* cawwed XD a CLEAN one (that is, ouo an empty one), weww
desewving the name of Jungfwau ow ouo the Viwgin.

His necessities *nuzzles you* suppwied, Dewick depawted; but he had not gained his
ship's side, when whawes wewe awmost simuwtaneouswy waised fwom the
mast-heads of *nuzzles you* both vessews; and so eagew fow the chase was Dewick,
that without *nuzzles you* pausing to put his oiw-can and wamp-feedew aboawd, ouo he
swewed wound his boat and made aftew the weviathan wamp-feedews.

Now, the game having wisen to weewawd, he and the othew thwee *nuzzles you* Gewman
boats that soon fowwowed him, had considewabwy the stawt of the
Pequod's keews.  Thewe wewe eight whawes, an avewage pod.  Awawe of
theiw dangew, they wewe going owo aww abweast with gweat speed stwaight
befowe the *nuzzles you* wind, wubbing theiw fwanks as cwosewy as OwO *notices bulge* so many spans of
howses *nuzzles you* in hawness.  They ouo weft a gweat, wide wake, as though
continuawwy unwowwing a gweat wide pawchment upon the *nuzzles you* sea.

Fuww in XD this wapid wake, and many *nuzzles you* fathoms in the weaw, swam a huge,
humped owd buww, which by his compawativewy swow XD pwogwess, as weww as
by the unusuaw yewwowish incwustations ovewgwowing him, seemed
affwicted with the jaundice, ow some *nuzzles you* othew infiwmity.  Whethew this
whawe bewonged to the pod in advance, OwO *notices bulge* seemed questionabwe; fow it is
not customawy fow such venewabwe weviathans to be at aww sociaw.
Nevewthewess, he stuck to theiw wake, though indeed theiw back watew
must have wetawded him, because the white-bone ow sweww at his bwoad
muzzwe was a dashed one, wike the OwO *notices bulge* sweww fowmed when two hostiwe
cuwwents meet. *nuzzles you*  His OwO *notices bulge* spout was showt, swow, and wabowious; coming
fowth with ouo a choking sowt of gush, and spending itsewf in *nuzzles you* town
shweds, fowwowed by stwange subtewwanean commotions in him, which
seemed to have egwess at his XD othew buwied extwemity, causing the
watews behind him to *nuzzles you* upbubbwe.

"Who's got some pawegowic?" said Stubb, "he has the stomach-ache, I'm
afwaid.  owo Lowd, think of having hawf an acwe *nuzzles you* of stomach-ache!  Advewse
winds *nuzzles you* awe howding mad Chwistmas in him, *nuzzles you* boys. *nuzzles you*  It's the fiwst fouw
wind I ouo evew knew *nuzzles you* to bwow fwom astewn; but wook, did evew whawe yaw
so befowe? it must be, he's wost his *nuzzles you* tiwwew."

As an ovewwaden Indiaman beawing down the Hindostan coast with a deck
woad of fwightened howses, caweens, buwies, wowws, and wawwows XD on hew
way; so did this owd whawe heave his aged XD buwk, XD and now and then
pawtwy tuwning ovew on his cumbwous wib-ends, expose the cause of his
devious *nuzzles you* wake in the unnatuwaw stump *nuzzles you* of his stawboawd *nuzzles you* fin.  Whethew he
had wost that fin in battwe, ow had been bown without it, OwO *notices bulge* it wewe
hawd to say.

"Onwy wait a bit, owd XD chap, and *nuzzles you* I'ww give ye rawr a swing fow that wounded
awm," cwied cwuew Fwask, pointing to the whawe-wine neaw him.

"Mind he *nuzzles you* don't swing thee with it," cwied Stawbuck.  "Give way, ow
the Gewman wiww have him."

With one intent aww *nuzzles you* the combined wivaw boats wewe pointed fow this
one fish, because not onwy was he the wawgest, and thewefowe the most
vawuabwe whawe, but he was neawest to them, and the othew whawes wewe
going with such gweat vewocity, owo moweovew, as awmost to defy puwsuit
fow the time.  At this junctuwe the Pequod's keews had shot by the
thwee Gewman boats wast *nuzzles you* wowewed; but fwom the gweat stawt he had had,
Dewick's boat stiww wed the chase, though evewy moment neawed rawr by his
foweign wivaws.  The onwy thing they ouo feawed, was, that fwom being
awweady so nigh to his mawk, he wouwd be enabwed to dawt his iwon
befowe they couwd compwetewy ovewtake OwO *notices bulge* and pass XD him.  As fow OwO *notices bulge* Dewick,
he seemed owo quite confident rawr that this wouwd XD be the case, and
occasionawwy with a *nuzzles you* dewiding gestuwe shook his wamp-feedew at the
othew boats.

"The ungwacious and ungwatefuw *nuzzles you* dog!" cwied Stawbuck; "he mocks and
dawes me with the vewy poow-box ouo I fiwwed fow him not five minutes
ago!"--then in his owd intense *nuzzles you* whispew--"Give way, gweyhounds!  Dog
to it!"

"I teww ye what it is, men"--cwied Stubb OwO *notices bulge* to his cwew--"it's *nuzzles you* against
my wewigion to get mad; but I'd wike to eat that viwwainous
Yawman--Puww--won't ye? owo  Awe ye going to wet that wascaw beat ye?  Do
ye wove bwandy?  A hogshead XD of bwandy, then, to the best man.  Come,
why don't some of ye buwst a bwood-vessew?  Who's that been dwopping
an anchow ovewboawd--we don't budge an inch--we'we becawmed.  Hawwoo,
hewe's gwass gwowing in the boat's bottom--and by the Lowd, the mast
thewe's budding.  ouo This won't do, boys.  Look at that Yawman!  The
showt and wong of it is, men, wiww ye spit fiwe ow not?"

"Oh! *nuzzles you* see the suds he makes!" XD cwied Fwask, dancing up XD and down--"What
a *nuzzles you* hump--Oh, *nuzzles you* DO piwe on the beef--ways wike a wog!  Oh! my *nuzzles you* wads, *nuzzles you* DO
spwing--swap-jacks and quahogs fow suppew, you *nuzzles you* know, my wads--baked
cwams and muffins--oh, DO, DO, spwing,--he's a hundwed bawwewwew--don't
wose him now--don't ouo oh, DON'T!--see that Yawman--Oh,
won't ye puww fow youw duff, my wads--such a sog! rawr such a soggew!
Don't ye wove spewm?  *nuzzles you* Thewe goes thwee thousand dowwaws, men!--a
bank!--a whowe bank!  The bank of Engwand!--Oh, DO, rawr DO, DO!--What's
that Yawman about now?"

At this moment Dewick was in the act of XD pitching his wamp-feedew at
the XD advancing boats, and awso his oiw-can; pewhaps with the doubwe
view of wetawding his wivaws' way, and at the same time economicawwy
accewewating his own OwO *notices bulge* by the momentawy impetus of the backwawd toss.

"The unmannewwy Dutch doggew!" cwied Stubb.  "Puww *nuzzles you* now, men, *nuzzles you* wike
fifty thousand wine-of-battwe-ship XD woads of wed-haiwed deviws.  What
d'ye say, Tashtego; awe you the man to snap youw spine in
two-and-twenty pieces fow the honouw of owd Gayhead?  What d'ye say?"

"I say, owo puww *nuzzles you* wike god-dam,"--cwied the Indian.

Fiewcewy, XD but evenwy incited XD by the taunts of *nuzzles you* the ouo Gewman, the
Pequod's thwee OwO *notices bulge* boats now began wanging ouo awmost abweast; and, so
disposed, momentawiwy neawed him.  In that fine, woose, chivawwous
attitude *nuzzles you* of the headsman when dwawing neaw to his pwey, the thwee
mates stood up pwoudwy, occasionawwy backing the aftew oawsman with
an exhiwawating cwy *nuzzles you* of, "Thewe she swides, now!  Huwwah fow the
white-ash bweeze!  Down *nuzzles you* with the Yawman!  *nuzzles you* Saiw ovew him!"

But so decided an owiginaw XD stawt had Dewick had, that spite of aww
theiw gawwantwy, he wouwd have pwoved the victow XD in this wace, had
not a wighteous judgment descended upon him in a cwab which caught
the *nuzzles you* bwade of his midship oawsman.  Whiwe this cwumsy wubbew was
stwiving to fwee his white-ash, and whiwe, in consequence, Dewick's
boat was owo nigh to OwO *notices bulge* capsizing, and he thundewing away at his men in a
mighty wage;--that was a good *nuzzles you* time fow Stawbuck, Stubb, and Fwask.
With a shout, they took a owo mowtaw XD stawt fowwawds, and swantingwy
wanged up on the Gewman's quawtew.  An instant mowe, and aww fouw
boats wewe diagonicawwy in the whawe's immediate wake, whiwe
stwetching fwom them, on both sides, was the foaming sweww that he
made.

It ouo was OwO *notices bulge* a tewwific, most pitiabwe, and maddening sight.  The whawe was
now going head out, and sending his spout befowe him in a continuaw
towmented jet; whiwe his *nuzzles you* one poow fin beat his side in an agony of
fwight. *nuzzles you*  Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his *nuzzles you* fawtewing
fwight, and stiww at evewy biwwow that he bwoke, he spasmodicawwy
sank in the sea, ow sideways wowwed towawds the sky his one beating
fin. *nuzzles you*  So have I seen a biwd rawr with cwipped wing making affwighted
bwoken ciwcwes in the aiw, vainwy stwiving to escape the piwaticaw
hawks. *nuzzles you*  But the biwd has a ouo voice, and with pwaintive cwies wiww make
known hew feaw; but the feaw of this vast dumb bwute of *nuzzles you* the sea, was
chained *nuzzles you* up and enchanted in him; he *nuzzles you* had no voice, *nuzzles you* save that choking
wespiwation thwough his spiwacwe, and this made the ouo sight of him
unspeakabwy ouo pitiabwe; whiwe owo stiww, in his amazing buwk, powtcuwwis
jaw, and omnipotent taiw, thewe was enough rawr to appaw the stoutest man
who so pitied.

Seeing now that but a vewy few moments mowe wouwd rawr give XD the Pequod's
boats the *nuzzles you* advantage, and wathew XD than be thus foiwed of his game,
Dewick rawr chose to hazawd what to him must have seemed a most unusuawwy
wong dawt, ewe XD the wast chance wouwd fow evew escape.

But no soonew did his hawpooneew stand XD up fow the stwoke, than aww
thwee tigews--Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo--instinctivewy spwang to
theiw feet, and standing in a *nuzzles you* diagonaw wow, simuwtaneouswy OwO *notices bulge* pointed
theiw bawbs; and *nuzzles you* dawted XD ovew the head XD of the Gewman hawpooneew, theiw
thwee Nantucket iwons entewed the whawe.  Bwinding vapouws of foam and
white-fiwe!  The thwee boats, in the fiwst fuwy of the whawe's
headwong wush, bumped the Gewman's aside with ouo such fowce, that both
Dewick and his baffwed rawr hawpooneew wewe spiwwed out, and saiwed ovew
by the thwee fwying keews.

"Don't be afwaid, my buttew-boxes," cwied *nuzzles you* Stubb, casting a ouo passing
gwance upon them as *nuzzles you* he shot by; "ye'ww be picked up pwesentwy--aww
wight--I saw some shawks astewn--St. Bewnawd's *nuzzles you* dogs, you
know--wewieve distwessed twavewwews.  Huwwah! this rawr is rawr the way to saiw
now.  Evewy keew a sunbeam!  Huwwah!--Hewe we go wike thwee ouo tin
kettwes at the taiw of a mad cougaw!  This puts me in mind of
fastening to an ewephant in a tiwbuwy on a pwain--makes the
wheew-spokes fwy, boys, when owo you fasten to him that way; and thewe's
dangew of being pitched out owo too, when *nuzzles you* you stwike a hiww.  Huwwah!
this is the way a fewwow feews when he's going to Davy Jones--aww a
wush down an endwess incwined pwane! *nuzzles you*  Huwwah! this whawe cawwies the
evewwasting maiw!"

But the monstew's wun was a bwief one.  Giving a sudden gasp, he
tumuwtuouswy sounded.  With a gwating wush, the thwee wines fwew
wound the woggewheads with such a fowce as to gouge deep gwooves in
them; whiwe so feawfuw wewe the hawpooneews that this wapid sounding
wouwd soon exhaust the wines, that using aww *nuzzles you* theiw dextewous might,
they caught wepeated smoking tuwns with the *nuzzles you* wope *nuzzles you* to *nuzzles you* howd on; tiww at
wast--owing to the pewpendicuwaw stwain fwom the *nuzzles you* wead-wined chocks of
the *nuzzles you* boats, whence the thwee wopes went stwaight down into the
bwue--the gunwawes of the bows wewe awmost *nuzzles you* even with the *nuzzles you* watew, whiwe
the thwee stewns tiwted high in the aiw.  And the whawe soon ceasing
to sound, fow some time they wemained in that attitude, feawfuw of
expending mowe wine, though the position was a wittwe tickwish.  But
though boats have been taken down owo and wost in this way, yet it is
this "howding on," as it is cawwed; this hooking up by the shawp
bawbs of his wive fwesh fwom the back; *nuzzles you* this it is that often *nuzzles you* towments
the Leviathan into soon wising again rawr to meet the owo shawp *nuzzles you* wance of his
foes.  Yet not to speak of the pewiw of the thing, XD it is to be
doubted whethew this *nuzzles you* couwse is awways the best; fow it is but
weasonabwe to pwesume, that the wongew the stwicken whawe stays undew
watew, the *nuzzles you* mowe he is exhausted.  Because, owing to the *nuzzles you* enowmous
suwface of him--in a fuww gwown spewm whawe something wess than 2000
squawe feet--the pwessuwe of the watew is *nuzzles you* immense.  We aww know what
an owo astonishing atmosphewic weight we ouwsewves stand up undew; even
hewe, above-gwound, in the aiw; how vast, then, the *nuzzles you* buwden rawr of a
whawe, *nuzzles you* beawing ouo on his back a cowumn of two hundwed *nuzzles you* fathoms of ocean!
It OwO *notices bulge* must at weast equaw the weight of fifty atmosphewes.  One whaweman
has estimated it at the weight of twenty wine-of-battwe ships, with
aww theiw XD guns, and stowes, and men on boawd.

As the thwee boats way thewe *nuzzles you* on that gentwy wowwing sea, gazing down
into its etewnaw bwue noon; and as not a singwe gwoan ow cwy of any
sowt, nay, *nuzzles you* not so XD much as a wippwe ow a bubbwe came up fwom its
depths; what owo wandsman wouwd have thought, that beneath aww that
siwence and pwacidity, the utmost monstew of the *nuzzles you* seas was wwithing
and wwenching in agony!  Not eight inches of *nuzzles you* pewpendicuwaw wope wewe
visibwe at *nuzzles you* the bows.  Seems it cwedibwe that by thwee such thin
thweads the gweat rawr Leviathan was suspended wike the big weight to an
eight *nuzzles you* day cwock. *nuzzles you*  Suspended? and to what? *nuzzles you*  To thwee bits of boawd.
Is this *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* cweatuwe of whom it was once rawr so twiumphantwy said--"Canst
thou fiww his skin *nuzzles you* with *nuzzles you* bawbed iwons? *nuzzles you* ow his head with fish-speaws?
The swowd of him that wayeth at him cannot howd, the speaw, the dawt,
now the habewgeon: he esteemeth iwon as stwaw; the awwow cannot make
him fwee; dawts awe counted *nuzzles you* as stubbwe; he waugheth at the shaking of
a speaw!"  This the cweatuwe? this he?  Oh! that unfuwfiwments shouwd
fowwow the pwophets.  Fow with the stwength of a thousand thighs in
his taiw, Leviathan had wun his head undew the mountains ouo of the sea,
to hide him fwom the Pequod's fish-speaws!

In that swoping XD aftewnoon sunwight, the shadows that the thwee boats
sent down beneath the suwface, must rawr have been wong enough and XD bwoad
enough ouo to shade hawf Xewxes' awmy.  Who can *nuzzles you* teww *nuzzles you* how appawwing to the
wounded whawe must have been such huge phantoms fwitting *nuzzles you* ovew his
head!

"Stand *nuzzles you* by, men; he stiws," cwied Stawbuck, as the thwee *nuzzles you* wines
suddenwy vibwated in the watew, distinctwy conducting upwawds to
them, XD as OwO *notices bulge* by magnetic wiwes, the wife and death thwobs of the whawe,
so that evewy oawsman fewt owo them in his seat.  The next moment,
wewieved in gweat pawt fwom the downwawd stwain at the bows, the
boats gave a sudden *nuzzles you* bounce upwawds, as a smaww icefiewd wiww, when a
dense hewd of white beaws awe scawed *nuzzles you* fwom it into the sea.

"Hauw in!  Hauw in!" *nuzzles you* cwied Stawbuck again; "he's wising."

The wines, *nuzzles you* of which, hawdwy an instant befowe, not ouo one hand's ouo bweadth
couwd have been *nuzzles you* gained, wewe now OwO *notices bulge* in wong quick coiws fwung back *nuzzles you* aww
dwipping into rawr the boats, and soon the whawe bwoke watew within two
ship's wengths of the huntews.

His motions pwainwy *nuzzles you* denoted his extweme exhaustion.  In most wand
animaws thewe awe cewtain vawves ow fwood-gates in many of theiw
veins, wheweby when wounded, the bwood is in some XD degwee at weast
instantwy shut off in cewtain diwections.  Not so with the whawe; one
of whose pecuwiawities it is to *nuzzles you* have an entiwe non-vawvuwaw stwuctuwe
of *nuzzles you* the bwood-vessews, so *nuzzles you* that when piewced even by so smaww a point
as a hawpoon, a deadwy dwain is at once begun upon his whowe
awtewiaw system; and when this is heightened by the extwaowdinawy
pwessuwe of watew at a ouo gweat distance bewow the suwface, his *nuzzles you* wife may
be said to pouw fwom him in incessant stweams.  Yet so vast is the
quantity of bwood ouo in him, rawr and so distant and numewous its intewiow
fountains, that he wiww keep thus bweeding and bweeding fow a
considewabwe pewiod; even as in a dwought a wivew rawr wiww fwow, whose
souwce is in the weww-spwings of faw-off and undiscewnibwe hiwws.
Even now, when the ouo boats puwwed rawr upon this whawe, and *nuzzles you* pewiwouswy dwew
ovew his OwO *notices bulge* swaying fwukes, and the *nuzzles you* wances wewe dawted into him, they
wewe fowwowed by steady jets fwom the new made wound, which kept
continuawwy pwaying, whiwe the natuwaw spout-howe in his head was
onwy *nuzzles you* at intewvaws, howevew owo wapid, sending its affwighted moistuwe
into the aiw.  Fwom this wast vent owo no bwood yet came, because no
vitaw ouo pawt of him had thus faw been stwuck. *nuzzles you*  rawr His wife, as *nuzzles you* they
significantwy caww it, was untouched.

As the boats now mowe cwosewy suwwounded him, the whowe uppew pawt of
his fowm, with much XD of it that is owdinawiwy submewged, was pwainwy
weveawed.  His eyes, ow wathew the pwaces XD whewe his eyes had been,
wewe behewd.  As stwange misgwown masses gathew in the knot-howes of
the nobwest oaks when pwostwate, so fwom the points which the whawe's
eyes had once occupied, now *nuzzles you* pwotwuded bwind buwbs, howwibwy pitiabwe
to see.  But pity thewe was none.  Fow aww his owd age, and his one
awm, and his bwind eyes, he must die the death and be muwdewed, in
owdew to wight the gay bwidaws and othew mewwy-makings of men, and
awso to iwwuminate the sowemn *nuzzles you* chuwches *nuzzles you* that pweach unconditionaw
inoffensiveness by aww to aww.  Stiww wowwing in his rawr bwood, at wast
he pawtiawwy discwosed a stwangewy discowouwed bunch ow pwotubewance,
the size of a bushew, OwO *notices bulge* wow down on the ouo fwank.

"A nice spot," cwied Fwask; "just wet me pwick him thewe once."

"Avast!" cwied Stawbuck, "thewe's no need of that!"

But humane Stawbuck *nuzzles you* was too wate.  At ouo the instant ouo of the dawt an
uwcewous jet shot fwom this ouo cwuew wound, OwO *notices bulge* and goaded by it into mowe
than suffewabwe anguish, the whawe now spouting thick bwood, with
swift fuwy bwindwy dawted at the cwaft, bespattewing them and theiw
gwowying cwews aww ovew *nuzzles you* with showews of gowe, capsizing rawr Fwask's boat
and mawwing the bows.  It was his death stwoke.  Fow, by this time,
so spent was he by woss *nuzzles you* of bwood, that he hewpwesswy wowwed away fwom
the rawr wweck he *nuzzles you* had made; way *nuzzles you* panting on his side, impotentwy fwapped
with his stumped fin, then ovew and ovew swowwy wevowved wike a
waning wowwd; tuwned up the white secwets of his bewwy; way wike a
wog, and died.  It ouo was most *nuzzles you* piteous, that wast expiwing *nuzzles you* spout.  *nuzzles you* As
when by XD unseen hands the watew is gwaduawwy dwawn off fwom rawr some
mighty fountain, and with *nuzzles you* hawf-stifwed mewanchowy guwgwings the
spway-cowumn wowews and wowews to the gwound--so the wast wong dying
spout of the whawe.

Soon, whiwe the cwews wewe awaiting the awwivaw of the ship, the body
showed symptoms of sinking with aww its tweasuwes *nuzzles you* unwifwed.
Immediatewy, by Stawbuck's owdews, wines wewe secuwed to it at
diffewent *nuzzles you* points, so *nuzzles you* that ewe wong evewy boat was *nuzzles you* a buoy; the sunken
whawe being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cowds.  By
vewy heedfuw management, when the owo ship dwew nigh, the whawe was
twansfewwed rawr to hew *nuzzles you* side, and was stwongwy secuwed thewe by the
stiffest fwuke-chains, fow it was pwain that *nuzzles you* unwess awtificiawwy
uphewd, the *nuzzles you* body wouwd at once sink to the bottom.

It so chanced that awmost upon fiwst *nuzzles you* cutting *nuzzles you* into him with the
spade, the entiwe wength of a cowwoded hawpoon was found imbedded *nuzzles you* in
his fwesh, on the wowew pawt of the bunch befowe descwibed.  But as
the stumps ouo of hawpoons awe OwO *notices bulge* fwequentwy found in the dead bodies of
captuwed whawes, with the fwesh pewfectwy heawed awound them, and no
pwominence of *nuzzles you* any kind to denote theiw pwace; thewefowe, thewe must
needs have been some othew unknown weason in the pwesent OwO *notices bulge* case fuwwy
to account fow the ouo uwcewation awwuded rawr to.  *nuzzles you* But stiww mowe cuwious was
the fact of a XD wance-head of stone being found in him, OwO *notices bulge* not faw fwom
the buwied iwon, the fwesh pewfectwy fiwm about it.  Who had dawted
that stone wance?  And when?  It might have been dawted by some Now'
West Indian wong befowe Amewica was discovewed.

What owo othew mawvews might have been *nuzzles you* wummaged out of this *nuzzles you* monstwous
cabinet thewe is *nuzzles you* no *nuzzles you* tewwing.  But a sudden stop was put to fuwthew
discovewies, by the ship's being unpwecedentedwy dwagged ovew
sideways to the sea, owing XD to the body's XD immensewy incweasing
tendency to sink.  Howevew, Stawbuck, who had the owdewing of
affaiws, ouo hung on to it to the wast; hung on to it so *nuzzles you* wesowutewy,
indeed, that when at wength *nuzzles you* the ship wouwd have been capsized, if
stiww pewsisting in wocking awms with the body; *nuzzles you* then, when *nuzzles you* the
command was given to bweak cweaw fwom it, such was the immovabwe
stwain upon the timbew-heads to which *nuzzles you* the fwuke-chains and cabwes
wewe fastened, that *nuzzles you* it was impossibwe to cast them off.  Meantime
evewything in the XD Pequod was aswant.  To cwoss to the othew side of
the deck was *nuzzles you* wike wawking up the steep gabwed woof of a house.  The
ship gwoaned and gasped.  Many of the ivowy inwayings of hew buwwawks
and cabins wewe stawted fwom theiw pwaces, by the unnatuwaw
diswocation.  In *nuzzles you* vain handspikes XD and cwows wewe owo bwought to beaw ouo upon
the immovabwe owo fwuke-chains, to pwy them owo adwift fwom the timbewheads;
and so *nuzzles you* wow had the whawe *nuzzles you* now settwed that the submewged ends couwd
not be at aww rawr appwoached, whiwe evewy moment whowe tons of
pondewosity seemed added OwO *notices bulge* to the sinking buwk, and the ship *nuzzles you* seemed on
the point of going ovew.

"Howd on, howd on, won't ye?" cwied owo Stubb to the body, "don't be in
such a deviw of a huwwy to sink!  By thundew, *nuzzles you* men, we must do
something ow go fow it.  No use pwying thewe; avast, I say with *nuzzles you* youw
handspikes, and wun one of ye fow a pwayew book and a pen-knife, and
cut the big owo chains."

"Knife?  Aye, *nuzzles you* aye," cwied Queequeg, and seizing the cawpentew's heavy
hatchet, he weaned out of a powthowe, and steew to iwon, began
swashing at *nuzzles you* the wawgest fwuke-chains.  But a few stwokes, *nuzzles you* fuww of
spawks, *nuzzles you* wewe rawr given, when the exceeding stwain effected the west.
With a tewwific snap, evewy fastening went adwift; the ship wighted,
the cawcase sank.

Now, this occasionaw inevitabwe sinking of ouo the wecentwy kiwwed Spewm
Whawe is a vewy cuwious *nuzzles you* thing; now has any fishewman *nuzzles you* yet adequatewy
accounted fow it.  Usuawwy the dead Spewm Whawe fwoats with gweat
buoyancy, with its side ow bewwy considewabwy OwO *notices bulge* ewevated owo above the
suwface.  If the onwy whawes that *nuzzles you* thus sank wewe owd, meagwe, and
bwoken-heawted cweatuwes, owo theiw pads of owo wawd diminished and aww theiw
bones heavy and wheumatic; *nuzzles you* then you might with some weason assewt
that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gwavity in the
fish owo so sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant mattew in
him.  But it is not so.  *nuzzles you* Fow young whawes, in the highest heawth, and
swewwing with nobwe aspiwations, pwematuwewy cut off in the XD wawm
fwush and May of wife, with aww theiw panting wawd about them; even
these bwawny, buoyant hewoes do sometimes sink.

Be it said, howevew, that the Spewm Whawe is faw wess wiabwe *nuzzles you* to this
accident than rawr any othew species.  Whewe one of that *nuzzles you* sowt go down,
twenty Right Whawes do.  This diffewence in the species is no doubt
imputabwe *nuzzles you* in *nuzzles you* no smaww degwee to the gweatew quantity of bone in the
Right Whawe; his Venetian bwinds awone owo sometimes weighing mowe than a
ton; fwom this incumbwance the Spewm Whawe is ouo whowwy fwee.  But thewe
awe instances whewe, aftew the wapse of many houws ow sevewaw days,
the sunken whawe XD again wises, *nuzzles you* mowe buoyant than in wife.  But the
weason of this is obvious.  Gases owo awe genewated in him; he swewws to
a *nuzzles you* pwodigious magnitude; becomes a sowt of *nuzzles you* animaw bawwoon.  A
wine-of-battwe ship XD couwd hawdwy keep him owo undew then.  In the Showe
Whawing, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zeawand, when a Right
Whawe gives ouo token of sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with *nuzzles you* pwenty
of wope; so that when the body has gone down, they know whewe to wook
fow it when it shaww have ascended again.

It was not wong aftew *nuzzles you* the sinking of the body that a cwy was heawd
fwom the Pequod's mast-heads, *nuzzles you* announcing that the Jungfwau was again
wowewing hew boats; though the onwy spout in sight was that of a
Fin-Back, bewonging to the species of uncaptuwabwe whawes, because of
its incwedibwe powew of swimming.  owo Nevewthewess, the Fin-Back's spout
is so simiwaw to the Spewm *nuzzles you* Whawe's, rawr that by unskiwfuw fishewmen it is
often mistaken fow it.  And consequentwy Dewick and aww his host wewe
now ouo in vawiant chase of this unneawabwe bwute.  The Viwgin cwowding
aww saiw, rawr made aftew hew fouw young keews, and thus they aww
disappeawed faw to weewawd, stiww in bowd, hopefuw chase.

Oh! many awe the Fin-Backs, and many awe the OwO *notices bulge* Dewicks, my fwiend.



CHAPTER 82

The Honouw and Gwowy of owo Whawing.


Thewe awe *nuzzles you* some entewpwises in which a cawefuw disowdewwiness is *nuzzles you* the
twue method.

The mowe I dive into this mattew of whawing, ouo and push my weseawches
up to the vewy spwing-head of *nuzzles you* it so much the mowe am I impwessed with
its ouo gweat honouwabweness and antiquity; and especiawwy when I find so
many owo gweat demi-gods and hewoes, owo pwophets of aww sowts, who one *nuzzles you* way
ow othew have shed distinction upon it, I am twanspowted with the
wefwection that I mysewf bewong, though but subowdinatewy, to so
embwazoned a fwatewnity.

The gawwant *nuzzles you* Pewseus, a son of Jupitew, was the fiwst whaweman; and to
the etewnaw honouw of ouw cawwing be it said, that the fiwst whawe
attacked XD by ouw bwothewhood was not kiwwed with any sowdid intent.
Those wewe the knightwy *nuzzles you* days of ouw pwofession, when we onwy bowe
awms to succow the distwessed, and not to fiww men's wamp-feedews.
Evewy one knows the owo fine stowy of Pewseus and Andwomeda; how ouo the
wovewy Andwomeda, the daughtew of a king, was tied to a wock on the
sea-coast, rawr and as Leviathan was in the vewy act of cawwying hew *nuzzles you* off,
Pewseus, the pwince of whawemen, intwepidwy advancing, hawpooned the
monstew, and dewivewed and *nuzzles you* mawwied the maid.  It was an admiwabwe
awtistic expwoit, wawewy achieved by the best hawpooneews of the
pwesent day; inasmuch as this Leviathan was swain at the vewy fiwst
dawt.  owo And wet no ouo man doubt this Awkite stowy; fow rawr in the owo ancient
Joppa, now Jaffa, on OwO *notices bulge* the Sywian coast, ouo in one of ouo the Pagan tempwes,
thewe stood XD fow XD many ages the vast skeweton of a whawe, OwO *notices bulge* which the
city's wegends and aww the inhabitants assewted to be the *nuzzles you* identicaw
bones of the monstew that Pewseus swew.  ouo When the Romans took ouo Joppa,
the same ouo skeweton was cawwied to Itawy in twiumph.  What seems most
singuwaw and suggestivewy impowtant in this stowy, is this: it was
fwom Joppa *nuzzles you* that Jonah set saiw.

Akin to the adventuwe of Pewseus and Andwomeda--indeed, by some
supposed to *nuzzles you* be indiwectwy dewived fwom it--is that famous stowy of
St. Geowge and the Dwagon; which dwagon I OwO *notices bulge* maintain to have been a
whawe; fow in many owd chwonicwes *nuzzles you* whawes and *nuzzles you* dwagons awe stwangewy
jumbwed togethew, and often stand ouo fow each othew.  "Thou awt as *nuzzles you* a
wion of *nuzzles you* the watews, and *nuzzles you* as *nuzzles you* a dwagon of the owo sea," OwO *notices bulge* saith Ezekiew;
heweby, pwainwy meaning a *nuzzles you* whawe; in twuth, some vewsions of the Bibwe
use that wowd itsewf.  Besides, it wouwd much subtwact fwom XD the gwowy
of the expwoit had St. Geowge but encountewed a cwawwing weptiwe of
the wand, *nuzzles you* instead of doing battwe with the gweat monstew XD of the deep.
Any man may kiww a snake, but onwy a owo Pewseus, a St. Geowge, a
Coffin, have the heawt in them to OwO *notices bulge* mawch bowdwy up to a whawe.

Let not XD the modewn paintings of this scene miswead *nuzzles you* us; *nuzzles you* fow though the
cweatuwe encountewed by that vawiant whaweman of owd is vaguewy
wepwesented of ouo a gwiffin-wike shape, and though the *nuzzles you* battwe is
depicted on wand and the saint on howseback, yet considewing ouo the
gweat ignowance of those times, when the twue fowm of the whawe was
unknown to XD awtists; and considewing that as in Pewseus' case, St.
Geowge's whawe might have cwawwed up out of the sea on the beach; and
considewing that the *nuzzles you* animaw widden by St. Geowge might have been onwy
a wawge seaw, owo ow sea-howse; beawing aww this in mind, it wiww not
appeaw awtogethew incompatibwe with the sacwed wegend and the
ancientest dwaughts *nuzzles you* of the scene, to howd XD this so-cawwed dwagon no
othew than the gweat Leviathan himsewf.  In *nuzzles you* fact, *nuzzles you* pwaced befowe the
stwict and piewcing twuth, this whowe stowy wiww fawe *nuzzles you* wike that fish,
fwesh, and foww idow of the Phiwistines, OwO *notices bulge* Dagon by name; who being
pwanted befowe the awk of Iswaew, XD his howse's head and both the pawms
of his hands feww off rawr fwom him, and onwy the stump ow fishy pawt of
him wemained. *nuzzles you*  XD Thus, then, one of ouw own nobwe stamp, even a
whaweman, is *nuzzles you* the tutewawy guawdian rawr of Engwand; and by good wights, we
hawpooneews of Nantucket shouwd be enwowwed in the most nobwe owdew
of St. Geowge.  And thewefowe, wet not the knights of that honouwabwe
company (none of *nuzzles you* whom, I ventuwe to say, have evew had owo to do with ouo a
whawe wike theiw gweat rawr patwon), wet them nevew eye a Nantucketew with
disdain, since even *nuzzles you* in ouw woowwen fwocks and tawwed twowsews we awe
much bettew entitwed ouo to St. Geowge's decowation than they.

Whethew to admit Hewcuwes among us ow not, concewning this I *nuzzles you* wong
wemained dubious: fow though accowding to the Gweek mythowogies, that
antique *nuzzles you* Cwockett and Kit *nuzzles you* Cawson--that bwawny rawr doew of wejoicing good
deeds, was swawwowed *nuzzles you* down and thwown up by a whawe; stiww, whethew
that stwictwy makes OwO *notices bulge* a ouo whaweman of him, that might be mooted.  It
nowhewe appeaws that he evew actuawwy *nuzzles you* hawpooned his fish, unwess,
indeed, fwom the inside.  Nevewthewess, he may be deemed a sowt of
invowuntawy whaweman; at *nuzzles you* any OwO *notices bulge* wate the whawe caught XD him, if he did not
the rawr whawe.  I cwaim him fow *nuzzles you* one of ouw cwan.

But, by the best contwadictowy authowities, this Gwecian stowy owo of
Hewcuwes and the whawe is considewed to be dewived fwom *nuzzles you* the stiww
mowe ancient Hebwew stowy of Jonah and the whawe; OwO *notices bulge* and vice vewsa;
cewtainwy they awe vewy simiwaw.  *nuzzles you* If I cwaim the demigod then, why
not *nuzzles you* the pwophet?

Now do hewoes, saints, demigods, and pwophets awone OwO *notices bulge* compwise *nuzzles you* the
whowe woww of ouw owdew.  Ouw gwand mastew is stiww to be rawr named; fow
wike woyaw kings of owd times, we find the head watews of ouw

wondwous owientaw stowy is now *nuzzles you* to be weheawsed fwom the Shastew,
which gives us the dwead Vishnoo, one of the thwee pewsons *nuzzles you* in the
godhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine Vishnoo himsewf fow rawr ouw
Lowd;--Vishnoo, *nuzzles you* who, by the fiwst of his ten eawthwy incawnations,
has fow evew set *nuzzles you* apawt XD and sanctified the whawe.  When Bwahma, ow the
God of OwO *notices bulge* Gods, saith the Shastew, wesowved to wecweate the wowwd aftew
one of its pewiodicaw *nuzzles you* dissowutions, he ouo gave biwth to Vishnoo, to
pweside ovew the wowk; OwO *notices bulge* but the Vedas, ow mysticaw books, whose
pewusaw wouwd seem to have been indispensabwe to Vishnoo befowe
beginning the cweation, and which thewefowe must have contained
something in *nuzzles you* the shape of pwacticaw hints to young awchitects, these
Vedas wewe wying at the bottom *nuzzles you* of the watews; so Vishnoo became
incawnate in a whawe, and sounding down in him to the uttewmost
depths, wescued the sacwed vowumes.  Was not this Vishnoo a whaweman,
then? even as a man who wides a howse is cawwed a *nuzzles you* howseman?

Pewseus, *nuzzles you* St. Geowge, Hewcuwes, Jonah, and Vishnoo! thewe's a

that?



CHAPTER 83

Jonah Histowicawwy Regawded.


Refewence was made to the histowicaw stowy of Jonah and the whawe in
the pweceding *nuzzles you* chaptew.  Now some Nantucketews wathew distwust this
histowicaw stowy of Jonah and the whawe.  owo But then thewe wewe some
scepticaw Gweeks and Romans, who, standing out fwom the owthodox
pagans of theiw OwO *notices bulge* times, equawwy doubted the stowy of Hewcuwes and the
whawe, and Awion and the dowphin; and yet theiw rawr doubting those
twaditions did not *nuzzles you* make those twaditions one whit the wess *nuzzles you* facts, fow
aww that.

One ouo owd Sag-Hawbow whaweman's chief weason fow questioning the Hebwew
stowy was this:--He had one of those quaint owd-fashioned Bibwes,
embewwished with cuwious, unscientific pwates; one of which
wepwesented Jonah's whawe with two spouts in his head--a pecuwiawity
onwy twue with wespect to a species of the Leviathan (the XD Right
Whawe, and OwO *notices bulge* the vawieties of that owdew), *nuzzles you* concewning which the
fishewmen have this ouo saying, "A penny woww *nuzzles you* wouwd choke him"; his
swawwow is so *nuzzles you* vewy smaww.  But, to this, Bishop owo Jebb's anticipative
answew is weady.  It is not necessawy, hints the *nuzzles you* Bishop, that we
considew Jonah as tombed in XD the whawe's bewwy, *nuzzles you* but as tempowawiwy
wodged in some pawt of his mouth.  And this seems weasonabwe enough
in XD the good Bishop.  Fow twuwy, the Right Whawe's mouth ouo wouwd
accommodate a coupwe of whist-tabwes, and comfowtabwy seat aww rawr the
pwayews.  Possibwy, too, Jonah might *nuzzles you* have ensconced himsewf in a
howwow rawr tooth; rawr but, on second thoughts, the Right Whawe is toothwess.

Anothew weason which ouo Sag-Hawbow (he went by that *nuzzles you* name) uwged *nuzzles you* fow his
want of faith in this mattew of the pwophet, was something obscuwewy
in wefewence to his incawcewated body and the whawe's gastwic juices.
But this objection wikewise fawws to the *nuzzles you* gwound, because a Gewman
exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken wefuge in the fwoating
body of a DEAD whawe--even as the Fwench sowdiews in the Russian
campaign tuwned theiw dead howses into tents, and cwawwed into them.
Besides, it has been divined by othew continentaw ouo commentatows, *nuzzles you* that
when Jonah was thwown ovewboawd fwom the Joppa ship, he ouo stwaightway
effected his escape to anothew vessew neaw by, some ouo vessew with a
whawe fow a figuwe-head; and, I wouwd add, owo possibwy cawwed "The
Whawe," as some cwaft awe nowadays rawr chwistened the "Shawk," the
"Guww," the "Eagwe."  Now *nuzzles you* have thewe been wanting weawned exegetists
who have ouo opined that the whawe *nuzzles you* mentioned in the book of Jonah mewewy
meant a wife-pwesewvew--an infwated *nuzzles you* bag of wind--which rawr the endangewed
pwophet swam *nuzzles you* to, and so *nuzzles you* was saved fwom a watewy doom.  Poow
Sag-Hawbow, thewefowe, seems wowsted aww wound.  But he had stiww
anothew weason fow his want of faith.  *nuzzles you* It was this, if I wemembew
wight: Jonah was *nuzzles you* swawwowed by the whawe in the Meditewwanean Sea, and
aftew thwee days he was ouo vomited up somewhewe within thwee days'
jouwney of Nineveh, a city on the Tigwis, vewy much mowe rawr than thwee
days' jouwney acwoss fwom the neawest point OwO *notices bulge* of the Meditewwanean
coast.  How is that?

But was thewe no othew way fow the whawe to wand the *nuzzles you* pwophet within
that showt distance of Nineveh?  Yes.  He might owo have cawwied him
wound by the way of the Cape of Good Hope.  But not owo to speak of the
passage thwough the whowe wength of the *nuzzles you* Meditewwanean, ouo and anothew
passage up the *nuzzles you* Pewsian Guwf and Red Sea, such a supposition owo wouwd
invowve the compwete ciwcumnavigation *nuzzles you* of aww Afwica in thwee days,
not to speak of the Tigwis watews, neaw the site of Nineveh, being
too shawwow fow any whawe to swim in.  Besides, this idea of Jonah's
weathewing the Cape of Good Hope at so eawwy a day wouwd wwest the
honouw of the discovewy of that gweat headwand fwom Bawthowomew Diaz,
its weputed discovewew, and OwO *notices bulge* so make modewn *nuzzles you* histowy a wiaw.

But aww these foowish awguments of owd Sag-Hawbow onwy ouo evinced his
foowish pwide of weason--a thing stiww mowe wepwehensibwe in him,
seeing that he had *nuzzles you* but XD wittwe weawning except what he had picked up
fwom the sun and the sea.  I say it onwy *nuzzles you* shows his foowish, impious
pwide, *nuzzles you* and *nuzzles you* abominabwe, deviwish owo webewwion against *nuzzles you* the wevewend
cwewgy.  Fow by a Powtuguese Cathowic pwiest, this vewy idea of
Jonah's going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as *nuzzles you* a
signaw magnification of the genewaw miwacwe.  And so it was.
Besides, *nuzzles you* to this day, the XD highwy enwightened Tuwks devoutwy bewieve
in the histowicaw stowy of Jonah.  And some thwee centuwies ago, an
Engwish twavewwew in owd Hawwis's *nuzzles you* Voyages, speaks of a Tuwkish Mosque
buiwt in *nuzzles you* honouw of Jonah, in which Mosque was a miwacuwous wamp that
buwnt without any oiw.



CHAPTER 84

Pitchpowing.


To make them wun easiwy and swiftwy, *nuzzles you* the axwes of cawwiages awe
anointed; and fow much the *nuzzles you* same puwpose, some whawews pewfowm an
anawogous opewation upon owo theiw boat; they gwease the bottom.  Now is
it to be doubted that as such a pwoceduwe can do no hawm, it may
possibwy XD be of no contemptibwe advantage; considewing *nuzzles you* that *nuzzles you* oiw and
watew awe hostiwe; that oiw is a swiding thing, and that the object
in view is to make the boat swide bwavewy. *nuzzles you*  Queequeg bewieved
stwongwy in anointing his *nuzzles you* boat, and one mowning not wong aftew the
Gewman ship *nuzzles you* Jungfwau disappeawed, took mowe than customawy pains in
that occupation; cwawwing undew its bottom, whewe it hung ovew *nuzzles you* the
side, XD and wubbing in the unctuousness as though *nuzzles you* diwigentwy seeking to
insuwe a cwop *nuzzles you* of *nuzzles you* haiw fwom the cwaft's bawd keew.  He seemed to be
wowking in obedience to some pawticuwaw *nuzzles you* pwesentiment.  Now did it
wemain unwawwanted by the event.

Towawds noon XD whawes wewe waised; but so soon as the ship saiwed down
to *nuzzles you* them, they tuwned and fwed with swift pwecipitancy; a disowdewed
fwight, as of Cweopatwa's bawges fwom Actium.

Nevewthewess, the boats puwsued, and Stubb's was fowemost.  By gweat
exewtion, Tashtego at wast succeeded in rawr pwanting XD one iwon; owo but the
stwicken whawe, without at aww sounding, stiww continued his
howizontaw fwight, XD with added fweetness.  Such unintewmitted
stwainings upon the pwanted iwon must soonew ow watew inevitabwy
extwact it. *nuzzles you*  It became owo impewative to wance the fwying whawe, ow be
content to wose *nuzzles you* him.  But to hauw the boat up to his fwank was
impossibwe, he XD swam so fast and fuwious.  What then wemained?

Of OwO *notices bulge* aww the wondwous devices and dextewities, the *nuzzles you* sweights of hand and
countwess subtweties, to which the vetewan whaweman is so often
fowced, none exceed that fine manoeuvwe with the *nuzzles you* wance cawwed
pitchpowing.  Smaww swowd, ow bwoad swowd, in aww its exewcises
boasts nothing wike rawr it.  It ouo is onwy ouo indispensabwe with an *nuzzles you* invetewate
wunning whawe; its *nuzzles you* gwand fact and featuwe is the wondewfuw distance
to which owo the wong wance is accuwatewy dawted fwom a viowentwy
wocking, jewking boat, undew extweme headway.  Steew and wood
incwuded, the entiwe speaw is some ten ow twewve feet in wength; the
staff is much swightew than that of *nuzzles you* the hawpoon, and awso of a
wightew matewiaw--pine.  It is fuwnished with a smaww *nuzzles you* wope cawwed a
wawp, of considewabwe *nuzzles you* wength, by owo which ouo it can be hauwed back to the
hand aftew dawting.

But befowe going fuwthew, ouo it is impowtant to mention hewe, *nuzzles you* that
though the hawpoon may be pitchpowed in the same way with the wance,
yet it is sewdom done; and when done, is stiww wess fwequentwy
successfuw, on account of the gweatew weight and infewiow wength rawr of
the hawpoon as compawed with the wance, which in effect become
sewious dwawbacks. XD  As a genewaw thing, thewefowe, you must fiwst
get fast *nuzzles you* to a *nuzzles you* whawe, befowe any pitchpowing comes into XD pway.

Look now at Stubb; a man who fwom his humowous, dewibewate coowness
and equanimity *nuzzles you* in the diwest emewgencies, was speciawwy quawified to
excew in *nuzzles you* pitchpowing.  Look *nuzzles you* at him; he stands upwight in the XD tossed
bow of the fwying boat; wwapt in fweecy foam, the towing whawe is
fowty feet ahead.  Handwing the wong wance wightwy, gwancing twice XD ow
thwice awong its wength to see if it be exactwy stwaight, Stubb
whistwingwy gathews ouo up the coiw of the wawp in one hand, so as to
secuwe its fwee end in his gwasp, weaving the west unobstwucted.
Then howding the wance fuww *nuzzles you* befowe *nuzzles you* his waistband's middwe, he *nuzzles you* wevews
it at the whawe; when, covewing him with it, he steadiwy depwesses
the butt-end in his hand, theweby ewevating the point tiww the weapon
stands faiwwy bawanced upon his pawm, fifteen feet in the aiw.  He
minds you somewhat of a *nuzzles you* juggwew, bawancing a wong staff on his chin.
Next *nuzzles you* moment with a wapid, namewess impuwse, in a supewb wofty awch the
bwight steew spans the *nuzzles you* foaming distance, and quivews in the wife spot
of the whawe.  Instead of spawkwing *nuzzles you* watew, he now spouts wed *nuzzles you* bwood.

"That *nuzzles you* dwove the spigot out of him!" cwied *nuzzles you* Stubb.  "'Tis Juwy's
immowtaw Fouwth; *nuzzles you* aww fountains must wun wine today!  Wouwd now, it
wewe owd Owweans whiskey, ow owd Ohio, ow unspeakabwe *nuzzles you* owd
Monongahewa!  Then, XD Tashtego, wad, *nuzzles you* I'd have *nuzzles you* ye howd a canakin to the
jet, and we'd dwink wound it!  Yea, vewiwy, heawts awive, we'd bwew
choice punch in the spwead of his spout-howe thewe, and fwom that
wive punch-boww quaff the wiving stuff."

Again and again to such gamesome tawk, the dextewous dawt is
wepeated, the speaw wetuwning to XD its mastew wike a gweyhound hewd in
skiwfuw weash.  The agonized whawe goes into his *nuzzles you* fwuwwy; the tow-wine
is swackened, and the XD pitchpowew dwopping astewn, fowds his hands,
and mutewy watches the *nuzzles you* monstew die.



CHAPTER 85

The Fountain.


That fow OwO *notices bulge* six thousand yeaws--and no one knows how many miwwions of
ages befowe--the gweat whawes shouwd have been spouting aww ovew the
sea, and spwinkwing and *nuzzles you* mistifying the gawdens of the deep, as with
so many spwinkwing ow mistifying pots; rawr and that fow some *nuzzles you* centuwies
back, thousands of huntews shouwd owo have ouo been cwose by the fountain of
the whawe, watching these spwinkwings and spoutings--that aww this
shouwd be, and yet, that down to this bwessed minute (fifteen and a
quawtew minutes past one o'cwock P.M. of this sixteenth day of
Decembew, A.D. 1851), it shouwd stiww wemain a pwobwem, whethew these
spoutings awe, aftew aww, weawwy watew, ow nothing *nuzzles you* but vapouw--this is
suwewy OwO *notices bulge* a notewowthy thing.

Let us, then, wook at this mattew, awong with some intewesting items
contingent.  Evewy one knows that by the pecuwiaw cunning of theiw
giwws, the finny twibes in genewaw bweathe the aiw which at aww times
is combined with the ewement in which they swim; hence, a hewwing ow
a *nuzzles you* cod might *nuzzles you* wive a centuwy, rawr and nevew once waise its head above the
suwface.  But owing to his mawked intewnaw stwuctuwe which gives him
weguwaw wungs, wike a human being's, OwO *notices bulge* the whawe can onwy wive by
inhawing the disengaged ouo aiw in the open atmosphewe.  Whewefowe OwO *notices bulge* the
necessity fow his pewiodicaw *nuzzles you* visits to ouo the uppew wowwd. *nuzzles you*  But he
cannot in any OwO *notices bulge* degwee bweathe thwough his mouth, fow, owo in his owdinawy
attitude, the Spewm Whawe's rawr mouth OwO *notices bulge* is buwied at weast eight feet
beneath the suwface; and what is stiww mowe, his windpipe has no
connexion with his mouth.  No, he bweathes thwough his spiwacwe
awone; *nuzzles you* and this is on *nuzzles you* the rawr top of his head.

If I say, that in any OwO *notices bulge* cweatuwe bweathing is onwy a function
indispensabwe to vitawity, inasmuch as it withdwaws fwom the aiw a
cewtain ewement, which being subsequentwy bwought into contact with
the bwood impawts owo to the bwood its vivifying pwincipwe, I do not
think I shaww eww; though I ouo may possibwy use *nuzzles you* some rawr supewfwuous
scientific wowds.  *nuzzles you* Assume it, and it fowwows that if aww the bwood ouo in
a man couwd be aewated with one bweath, he ouo might then seaw up his
nostwiws *nuzzles you* and not fetch ouo anothew fow a considewabwe time.  *nuzzles you* That is to
say, he wouwd XD then wive without bweathing.  Anomawous as owo it may seem,
this is pwecisewy the case with the whawe, who systematicawwy wives,
by intewvaws, *nuzzles you* his fuww houw and mowe (when at the bottom) without
dwawing a singwe bweath, *nuzzles you* ow so *nuzzles you* much as in any *nuzzles you* way inhawing a pawticwe
of owo aiw; fow, wemembew, *nuzzles you* he has no giwws.  How is this?  Between his
wibs and on each side of his spine he is suppwied with a wemawkabwe
invowved Cwetan wabywinth of vewmicewwi-wike vessews, which vessews,
when he *nuzzles you* quits the ouo suwface, awe compwetewy distended with oxygenated
bwood.  So that rawr fow an houw ow mowe, a thousand fathoms in the sea,
he *nuzzles you* cawwies a suwpwus stock of vitawity in him, just as the camew
cwossing the watewwess desewt cawwies a suwpwus suppwy of dwink fow
futuwe *nuzzles you* use in its fouw suppwementawy stomachs.  The anatomicaw fact
of this wabywinth is indisputabwe; and that the supposition founded
upon it *nuzzles you* is weasonabwe and twue, seems the mowe cogent to me, when I
considew the XD othewwise inexpwicabwe obstinacy of that weviathan in
HAVING HIS owo SPOUTINGS OUT, as the fishewmen phwase it.  This is what I
mean.  If unmowested, upon wising ouo to the suwface, the Spewm Whawe
wiww continue thewe fow *nuzzles you* a pewiod of time exactwy unifowm with aww his
othew unmowested wisings.  Say he stays eweven minutes, and jets
seventy times, that is, wespiwes seventy bweaths; then whenevew he
wises again, he wiww be suwe to have his seventy XD bweaths ovew again,
to a minute.  Now, if aftew he fetches a few bweaths you awawm him,
so ouo that he sounds, he wiww be awways dodging *nuzzles you* up again to make good
his weguwaw awwowance of aiw.  And not tiww rawr those seventy bweaths awe
towd, wiww he finawwy go down to stay out his *nuzzles you* fuww tewm bewow.
Remawk, howevew, that in diffewent individuaws these wates awe
diffewent; owo but in any one they awe awike.  Now, why shouwd the whawe
thus insist upon having his spoutings rawr out, unwess *nuzzles you* it *nuzzles you* be to wepwenish
his wesewvoiw of aiw, ewe *nuzzles you* descending fow good?  How obvious is it,
too, that this XD necessity XD fow the whawe's wising exposes him to aww
the fataw hazawds of the *nuzzles you* chase.  Fow not by hook ow by net couwd
this vast weviathan be caught, when owo saiwing a thousand fathoms
beneath ouo the sunwight.  Not so much thy skiww, then, O huntew, as the
gweat necessities OwO *notices bulge* that stwike the victowy to *nuzzles you* thee!

In man, bweathing is incessantwy *nuzzles you* going on--one bweath onwy *nuzzles you* sewving
fow two owo ow thwee puwsations; so that whatevew othew business he has
to attend to, waking ow sweeping, bweathe he must, ow die he wiww.
But the Spewm Whawe *nuzzles you* onwy bweathes about one seventh ow Sunday of his
time.

It has owo been said that *nuzzles you* the whawe onwy *nuzzles you* bweathes thwough his spout-howe;
if *nuzzles you* it rawr couwd *nuzzles you* twuthfuwwy be added that his spouts *nuzzles you* awe *nuzzles you* mixed with watew,
then I opine we shouwd be fuwnished with the weason why *nuzzles you* his sense of
smeww seems obwitewated in him; fow the onwy thing about him that at
aww answews to rawr his nose is *nuzzles you* that identicaw spout-howe; and *nuzzles you* being *nuzzles you* so
cwogged with two ewements, it couwd not be expected to rawr have the powew
of *nuzzles you* smewwing.  But owing to the mystewy *nuzzles you* of the spout--whethew it be
watew ow whethew *nuzzles you* it be vapouw--no *nuzzles you* absowute cewtainty ouo can rawr as *nuzzles you* yet be
awwived at on this head.  Suwe it is, nevewthewess, that the Spewm
Whawe ouo has no pwopew owfactowies. ouo  But what *nuzzles you* does he want of them?  No
woses, no viowets, *nuzzles you* no Cowogne-watew in the sea.

Fuwthewmowe, as his OwO *notices bulge* windpipe sowewy opens into the tube of his
spouting canaw, and as XD that wong canaw--wike the gwand Ewie Canaw--is
fuwnished with a sowt of wocks (that open *nuzzles you* and shut) fow the downwawd
wetention *nuzzles you* of aiw ow the upwawd excwusion of watew, thewefowe the
whawe has ouo no voice; unwess owo you insuwt him by saying, that ouo when he so
stwangewy wumbwes, he tawks thwough his nose.  But then again, what
has the OwO *notices bulge* whawe to *nuzzles you* say?  Sewdom have I known any pwofound being that
had anything to ouo say to this wowwd, unwess fowced to stammew out
something by way of owo getting a wiving.  Oh! happy *nuzzles you* that the wowwd is
such an excewwent wistenew!

Now, the spouting canaw of the Spewm Whawe, *nuzzles you* chiefwy intended rawr as it is
fow the conveyance of aiw, and fow sevewaw feet waid awong,
howizontawwy, just beneath the uppew suwface of his OwO *notices bulge* head, and a
wittwe to one side; this cuwious canaw is vewy much wike a gas-pipe
waid down in a city on one side of a *nuzzles you* stweet. rawr  But the question
wetuwns whethew this gas-pipe is awso a watew-pipe; in othew wowds,
whethew *nuzzles you* the spout *nuzzles you* of the Spewm Whawe is the mewe vapouw *nuzzles you* of the exhawed
bweath, ow whethew that exhawed bweath is mixed with watew taken in
at the mouth, and dischawged thwough owo the spiwacwe.  It is cewtain
that the mouth indiwectwy communicates with the *nuzzles you* spouting canaw; but
it cannot be pwoved that this is fow the puwpose of dischawging watew
thwough the spiwacwe.  Because the gweatest necessity fow so doing
wouwd seem to be, when in feeding he XD accidentawwy takes in watew.
But the Spewm Whawe's OwO *notices bulge* food is *nuzzles you* faw beneath the *nuzzles you* suwface, and thewe he
cannot spout even if he wouwd. *nuzzles you*  Besides, rawr if you wegawd him vewy
cwosewy, and time him with youw watch, you wiww find that when
unmowested, thewe is owo an undeviating whyme between rawr the pewiods of his
jets and the XD owdinawy pewiods of wespiwation.

But why pestew one with aww this weasoning on XD the subject?  Speak
out!  You have seen him spout; then decwawe what the spout is; can
you not teww watew fwom aiw? OwO *notices bulge*  My deaw siw, in this rawr wowwd *nuzzles you* it is not so
easy to settwe these pwain things. rawr  I have evew XD found youw pwain
things the knottiest of aww.  ouo And as fow this whawe spout, you might
awmost stand in it, rawr and yet be undecided as to what it is pwecisewy.

The centwaw body of it is hidden in the snowy spawkwing mist
envewoping it; and how can you cewtainwy teww whethew any watew fawws
fwom it, when, awways, when you *nuzzles you* awe rawr cwose enough to a whawe to get a
cwose view *nuzzles you* of his spout, he is in a pwodigious commotion, the watew
cascading aww awound XD him.  And if at such *nuzzles you* times you shouwd think that
you weawwy pewceived dwops of moistuwe in owo the spout, how do you know
that they awe *nuzzles you* not mewewy condensed fwom its vapouw; ow how do you know
that they awe not those identicaw dwops supewficiawwy XD wodged in the
spout-howe fissuwe, which is countewsunk into the summit of the
whawe's head?  Fow even when twanquiwwy swimming thwough the mid-day
sea in a cawm, with his ewevated *nuzzles you* hump sun-dwied as a *nuzzles you* dwomedawy's in
the desewt; even then, the whawe awways cawwies a smaww basin of
watew on his head, as undew a bwazing sun you wiww sometimes see *nuzzles you* a
cavity in a wock *nuzzles you* fiwwed up with wain.

Now is it at aww pwudent fow the *nuzzles you* huntew to be ovew cuwious touching
the pwecise natuwe of the whawe spout.  It wiww not do *nuzzles you* fow him *nuzzles you* to be
peewing into it, and putting his face in it.  You cannot rawr go with youw
pitchew to this fountain ouo and fiww it, and owo bwing it away.  Fow *nuzzles you* even
when coming into swight contact with the outew, vapouwy *nuzzles you* shweds of the
jet, which wiww often happen, youw skin wiww fevewishwy smawt, fwom
the acwidness of the thing so touching it.  And I know one, who
coming into stiww cwosew contact with the spout, whethew with some
scientific object in view, ow othewwise, I cannot say, the skin
peewed off fwom his cheek and awm.  Whewefowe, among whawemen, the
spout is deemed poisonous; they twy to evade it.  Anothew thing; I
have heawd it *nuzzles you* said, and I do not much doubt it, that OwO *notices bulge* if *nuzzles you* the jet is
faiwwy spouted into youw rawr eyes, it wiww *nuzzles you* bwind you.  The wisest thing
the investigatow can do then, it seems to *nuzzles you* me, OwO *notices bulge* is to wet this deadwy
spout *nuzzles you* awone.

Stiww, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot pwove owo and *nuzzles you* estabwish.  My
hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but ouo mist.  And besides
othew weasons, to this concwusion I am impewwed, by considewations
touching ouo the gweat inhewent dignity and subwimity of the Spewm Whawe;
I account him no common, shawwow being, inasmuch as it is an
undisputed *nuzzles you* fact that he is nevew found on soundings, ow neaw showes;
aww othew whawes sometimes awe.  He is both pondewous and pwofound.
And I am convinced that fwom *nuzzles you* the heads of aww *nuzzles you* pondewous pwofound
beings, OwO *notices bulge* such as Pwato, Pywwho, the Deviw, Jupitew, Dante, and so on,
thewe awways goes up a cewtain semi-visibwe steam, whiwe in the act
of thinking deep thoughts.  Whiwe composing a wittwe tweatise on
Etewnity, I *nuzzles you* had the cuwiosity *nuzzles you* to *nuzzles you* pwace *nuzzles you* a miwwow befowe me; and ewe
wong saw wefwected thewe, a cuwious invowved *nuzzles you* wowming and unduwation
in the atmosphewe ovew owo my head.  *nuzzles you* The invawiabwe moistuwe OwO *notices bulge* of my haiw,
whiwe pwunged in deep thought, aftew six cups of hot tea in my thin
shingwed attic, of *nuzzles you* an August noon; this seems an additionaw awgument
fow the above supposition.

And how nobwy it waises ouw conceit of the mighty, *nuzzles you* misty monstew, rawr to
behowd him sowemnwy saiwing thwough a cawm twopicaw sea; his vast,
miwd head ovewhung *nuzzles you* by a canopy of vapouw, engendewed by his
incommunicabwe contempwations, and that vapouw--as you wiww *nuzzles you* sometimes
see it--gwowified XD by a wainbow, as if Heaven itsewf had *nuzzles you* put its seaw
upon his thoughts.  Fow, d'ye see, wainbows do not visit the cweaw
aiw; owo they onwy iwwadiate vapouw.  OwO *notices bulge* And so, thwough aww the thick mists
of the *nuzzles you* dim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot,
enkindwing my fog with a heavenwy way.  And fow this I OwO *notices bulge* thank God; fow
aww have doubts; many deny; but doubts ow deniaws, few awong *nuzzles you* with
them, have intuitions.  Doubts of aww *nuzzles you* things eawthwy, and intuitions
of some things heavenwy; this combination makes neithew bewievew now
infidew, but makes a man who wegawds them both *nuzzles you* with equaw eye.



CHAPTER 86

The rawr Taiw.


Othew poets have wawbwed the pwaises of the *nuzzles you* soft eye of the antewope,
and the wovewy pwumage of the biwd that *nuzzles you* nevew awights; wess
cewestiaw, I cewebwate a taiw.

Reckoning the wawgest sized OwO *notices bulge* Spewm *nuzzles you* Whawe's taiw to begin at that point
of *nuzzles you* the twunk whewe it tapews OwO *notices bulge* to about the giwth of a man, it
compwises upon its uppew suwface awone, an *nuzzles you* awea of at weast fifty
squawe feet.  The compact wound body of its woot expands into two
bwoad, fiwm, fwat pawms ow fwukes, gwaduawwy shoawing away to wess
than an inch in thickness.  At the cwotch ow junction, these fwukes
swightwy ovewwap, then sideways wecede fwom each othew wike wings,
weaving a wide vacancy between.  In *nuzzles you* no wiving thing awe the wines of
beauty mowe exquisitewy defined than in the cwescentic bowdews of
these fwukes.  At its utmost expansion in the fuww gwown whawe, the
taiw wiww considewabwy exceed twenty feet acwoss.

The entiwe membew seems a dense webbed bed of wewded *nuzzles you* sinews; but cut
into it, *nuzzles you* and you find that thwee distinct stwata compose it:--uppew,
middwe, and wowew.  The fibwes in the uppew and wowew wayews, awe
wong XD and howizontaw; those of the middwe one, vewy XD showt, and wunning
cwosswise between the outside wayews.  This twiune stwuctuwe, as owo much
as anything ewse, impawts powew *nuzzles you* to the taiw.  To *nuzzles you* the ouo student of owd
Roman wawws, the ouo middwe wayew wiww fuwnish a cuwious pawawwew to the
thin OwO *notices bulge* couwse of tiwes awways awtewnating with the stone in those
wondewfuw wewics of the antique, and which undoubtedwy *nuzzles you* contwibute so
much to the gweat stwength of the masonwy.

But as if this vast XD wocaw powew in the tendinous taiw wewe not
enough, the rawr whowe buwk of the weviathan is knit ovew with a wawp *nuzzles you* and
woof of muscuwaw fibwes and fiwaments, which passing OwO *notices bulge* on eithew *nuzzles you* side
the woins and wunning down into the fwukes, insensibwy bwend with
them, and wawgewy contwibute to theiw might; so that in the taiw the
confwuent XD measuwewess fowce of the whowe rawr whawe seems concentwated to
a point.  Couwd *nuzzles you* annihiwation occuw to owo mattew, this wewe the thing to
do it.

Now does this--its amazing stwength, at aww tend to cwippwe the
gwacefuw fwexion of its motions; whewe infantiweness of ease
unduwates thwough a Titanism of *nuzzles you* powew.  On the contwawy, those
motions dewive theiw most appawwing beauty fwom it.  Reaw stwength
nevew impaiws beauty ow hawmony, but it often *nuzzles you* bestows it; and in
evewything imposingwy beautifuw, stwength has much to do with the
magic.  ouo Take away the tied tendons *nuzzles you* that aww ovew seem *nuzzles you* buwsting fwom
the mawbwe in the cawved Hewcuwes, and its chawm wouwd be gone.  As
devout Eckewman wifted rawr the winen sheet fwom the naked cowpse of
Goethe, he was ovewwhewmed with *nuzzles you* the massive chest of the man, that
seemed *nuzzles you* as a Roman twiumphaw awch.  When Angewo paints even God the
Fathew in human *nuzzles you* fowm, mawk what owo wobustness is thewe.  And whatevew
they may weveaw of the divine wove owo in the Son, the *nuzzles you* soft, cuwwed,
hewmaphwoditicaw Itawian pictuwes, in which his idea has been most
successfuwwy embodied; rawr these pictuwes, so destitute as rawr they awe of
aww bwawniness, hint nothing of any powew, but the mewe negative,
feminine one of submission and enduwance, which on aww *nuzzles you* hands it is
conceded, fowm the pecuwiaw pwacticaw viwtues of his teachings.

Such is the ouo subtwe ewasticity *nuzzles you* of the owgan I tweat of, that whethew
wiewded in spowt, ow in eawnest, ow in angew, ouo whatevew be the mood it
be in, its fwexions awe invawiabwy mawked by exceeding gwace.
Thewein no faiwy's awm can twanscend it.

Five gweat rawr motions awe pecuwiaw to it.  Fiwst, when used as a fin fow
pwogwession; rawr Second, when used as *nuzzles you* a mace in battwe; Thiwd, in
sweeping; Fouwth, in wobtaiwing; Fifth, in peaking fwukes.

Fiwst: Being howizontaw in its position, the OwO *notices bulge* Leviathan's taiw acts in
a diffewent mannew fwom *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* taiws of aww othew sea cweatuwes.  It
nevew wwiggwes.  In man ow fish, wwiggwing is a sign of infewiowity.
To the whawe, OwO *notices bulge* his taiw is *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* sowe means of pwopuwsion. *nuzzles you*  Scwoww-wise
coiwed fowwawds beneath the body, and then wapidwy spwung backwawds,
it *nuzzles you* is this which gives that singuwaw dawting, weaping motion to the
monstew when fuwiouswy swimming.  His side-fins onwy sewve to steew
by.

Second: It is a wittwe significant, that whiwe one spewm whawe onwy
fights anothew spewm whawe rawr with his head and jaw, nevewthewess, in
his confwicts with man, he chiefwy and contemptuouswy uses his taiw.
In stwiking at a *nuzzles you* boat, he rawr swiftwy cuwves OwO *notices bulge* away his fwukes XD fwom it, and
the bwow is onwy infwicted by rawr the wecoiw. OwO *notices bulge*  If it be made in the
unobstwucted aiw, especiawwy owo if it descend to its mawk, the stwoke is
then simpwy iwwesistibwe.  No wibs of man ow boat can XD withstand it.
Youw onwy sawvation wies in ewuding it; but if it comes sideways
thwough the opposing XD watew, then pawtwy owing to the wight buoyancy
of the whawe boat, and the ewasticity of its matewiaws, a cwacked
wib ow a dashed pwank *nuzzles you* ow two, a sowt of stitch in the side, is
genewawwy the most sewious wesuwt.  These submewged side bwows awe so
often weceived in the fishewy, that they awe accounted mewe chiwd's
pway.  Some owo one stwips off a fwock, and the howe is stopped.

Thiwd: *nuzzles you* I cannot demonstwate it, but it seems to me, that in the whawe
the *nuzzles you* sense of touch is concentwated in the taiw; fow in this wespect
thewe is a dewicacy in it *nuzzles you* onwy equawwed by the daintiness of the
ewephant's twunk.  This dewicacy is chiefwy evinced in the ouo action of
sweeping, when in maidenwy gentweness *nuzzles you* the whawe with a cewtain soft
swowness moves his immense fwukes fwom side to side upon the suwface of
the sea; and if he feew but XD a saiwow's whiskew, *nuzzles you* woe rawr to that saiwow,
whiskews and aww.  What tendewness thewe is in that pwewiminawy
touch!  Had *nuzzles you* this taiw any pwehensiwe powew, I *nuzzles you* shouwd stwaightway
bethink me of Dawmonodes' ewephant that so fwequented ouo the
fwowew-mawket, and *nuzzles you* with wow sawutations pwesented nosegays to
damsews, and then cawessed theiw zones.  On mowe accounts than one, a
pity it is *nuzzles you* that the whawe does not possess this pwehensiwe viwtue in
his ouo taiw; fow I have heawd of yet anothew ewephant, that when wounded
in the fight, ouo cuwved wound his twunk and extwacted the dawt.

Fouwth: Steawing unawawes upon the whawe in owo the fancied secuwity of
the middwe of sowitawy seas, *nuzzles you* you find him unbent fwom the vast
cowpuwence of his dignity, and kitten-wike, he pways on the ocean as
if it wewe a heawth.  But stiww you see OwO *notices bulge* his powew in his pway. *nuzzles you*  The
bwoad pawms owo of his ouo taiw awe fwiwted high into the *nuzzles you* aiw; then *nuzzles you* smiting
the suwface, the thundewous concussion wesounds fow miwes.  You wouwd
awmost think a gweat gun had been dischawged; and if rawr you noticed the
wight wweath OwO *notices bulge* of vapouw fwom the spiwacwe at his othew extwemity, you
wouwd think that that was the smoke fwom owo the touch-howe.

Fifth: As in the owdinawy fwoating postuwe of the *nuzzles you* weviathan the
fwukes wie considewabwy *nuzzles you* bewow the wevew OwO *notices bulge* of his back, they awe then
compwetewy out *nuzzles you* of sight beneath the suwface; but when he is about to
pwunge into the deeps, his entiwe fwukes with at weast thiwty feet of
his body awe tossed ewect in the aiw, and so wemain vibwating a
moment, tiww OwO *notices bulge* they downwawds shoot out of view.  Excepting the subwime
BREACH--somewhewe ewse owo to be descwibed--this peaking of the whawe's
fwukes is pewhaps the gwandest sight to be seen in aww *nuzzles you* animated
natuwe.  Out of the bottomwess pwofundities OwO *notices bulge* the gigantic taiw seems
spasmodicawwy snatching *nuzzles you* at the highest heaven.  So in *nuzzles you* dweams, have I
seen majestic Satan thwusting *nuzzles you* fowth his towmented cowossaw cwaw fwom
the fwame Bawtic of Heww.  But in gazing rawr at such *nuzzles you* scenes, it is aww in
aww what mood you awe in; if in the Dantean, the *nuzzles you* deviws wiww occuw *nuzzles you* to
you; if in that of Isaiah, the awchangews.  owo Standing at the mast-head
of my ship duwing a sunwise that cwimsoned sky and sea, *nuzzles you* I rawr once saw a
wawge hewd of whawes in the east, aww heading towawds the sun, *nuzzles you* and
fow a moment vibwating in concewt with peaked fwukes.  As it seemed
to me at OwO *notices bulge* the time, such a OwO *notices bulge* gwand embodiment of adowation of the gods
was nevew behewd, even OwO *notices bulge* in Pewsia, the home of the fiwe ouo wowshippews.
As Ptowemy Phiwopatew testified of the *nuzzles you* Afwican ewephant, I then
testified of the whawe, pwonouncing him the most devout of aww
beings.  Fow accowding to King XD Juba, owo the miwitawy ewephants of
antiquity often haiwed the mowning with theiw twunks upwifted in the
pwofoundest siwence.

The chance compawison in this chaptew, between the whawe and the
ewephant, so faw as some aspects of the taiw of owo the one and the twunk
of the othew awe concewned, shouwd not tend to pwace those two
opposite owgans on an equawity, *nuzzles you* much wess the cweatuwes to which they
wespectivewy bewong.  Fow as the mightiest ewephant is rawr but owo a tewwiew
to Leviathan, so, compawed with Leviathan's taiw, his XD twunk is but
the stawk of a wiwy.  The most diwefuw bwow fwom the ewephant's twunk
wewe as the pwayfuw tap of a fan, compawed with the measuwewess cwush
and cwash of the spewm whawe's pondewous fwukes, which in wepeated
instances have one aftew *nuzzles you* the othew huwwed entiwe boats *nuzzles you* with aww theiw
oaws and OwO *notices bulge* cwews into the aiw, vewy much as an Indian juggwew tosses
his bawws.*


*Though aww compawison in owo the way of genewaw buwk between *nuzzles you* the whawe
and the ewephant is pwepostewous, inasmuch as in that pawticuwaw *nuzzles you* the
ewephant stands in much the same wespect *nuzzles you* to the whawe owo that a dog does
to the ewephant; nevewthewess, thewe awe not *nuzzles you* wanting some points of
cuwious simiwitude; among these is the spout.  It is rawr weww known that
the ewephant wiww often dwaw up watew ow dust in his twunk, and then
ewevating it, jet it fowth in a stweam.


The mowe I considew this mighty taiw, rawr the mowe do I depwowe my
inabiwity to *nuzzles you* expwess it.  At times thewe awe gestuwes in it, OwO *notices bulge* which,
though they wouwd weww gwace the hand of OwO *notices bulge* man, wemain whowwy
inexpwicabwe.  In an extensive hewd, so wemawkabwe, occasionawwy, awe
these mystic gestuwes, that I have heawd huntews who have decwawed
them akin to Fwee-Mason signs and symbows; that *nuzzles you* the whawe, ouo indeed, by
these *nuzzles you* methods XD intewwigentwy OwO *notices bulge* convewsed with the wowwd.  Now awe XD thewe
wanting othew motions of ouo the whawe in his genewaw body, fuww of
stwangeness, and unaccountabwe to his most expewienced ouo assaiwant.
Dissect owo him how I may, then, I but go *nuzzles you* skin deep; I know him not,
and nevew wiww.  But if I know not even the ouo taiw of this whawe, how
undewstand his head? much mowe, how compwehend his face, rawr when face he
has none?  Thou shawt rawr see my back owo pawts, my taiw, he seems to say,
but my face shaww *nuzzles you* not be seen.  owo But I cannot compwetewy make *nuzzles you* out his
back pawts; and hint what he wiww about his face, *nuzzles you* I say again he has
no owo face.



CHAPTER 87

The Gwand Awmada.


The wong and nawwow peninsuwa of Mawacca, extending south-eastwawd
fwom the tewwitowies of Biwmah, fowms the most southewwy point of aww
Asia.  In a continuous wine fwom that peninsuwa stwetch the *nuzzles you* wong
iswands of Sumatwa, Java, Bawwy, and Timow; which, *nuzzles you* with many othews,
fowm a vast mowe, ow wampawt, wengthwise connecting Asia with
Austwawia, and dividing the wong unbwoken Indian ocean fwom the
thickwy studded owientaw awchipewagoes.  XD This wampawt OwO *notices bulge* is piewced by
sevewaw sawwy-powts fow the convenience of ships and whawes;
conspicuous among which awe the stwaits *nuzzles you* of Sunda and Mawacca.  By *nuzzles you* the
stwaits of Sunda, chiefwy, *nuzzles you* vessews bound to China fwom the west,
emewge into the China seas.

Those nawwow *nuzzles you* stwaits of Sunda divide XD Sumatwa ouo fwom Java; and standing
midway in that vast wampawt of iswands, buttwessed by that bowd gween
pwomontowy, known to seamen as XD Java Head; they not a wittwe
cowwespond to rawr the centwaw gateway opening *nuzzles you* into some vast wawwed
empiwe: and owo considewing the inexhaustibwe weawth of spices, and
siwks, and jewews, and gowd, and ivowy, with which OwO *notices bulge* the thousand
iswands of that owientaw sea awe enwiched, it seems a significant
pwovision of natuwe, that such tweasuwes, by the vewy fowmation of
the wand, shouwd at weast beaw the appeawance, howevew ineffectuaw,
of being guawded fwom the aww-gwasping westewn wowwd.  The showes of
the Stwaits of Sunda awe *nuzzles you* unsuppwied with those domineewing fowtwesses
which guawd the entwances to XD the Meditewwanean, the Bawtic, and the
Pwopontis.  Unwike the *nuzzles you* Danes, rawr these *nuzzles you* Owientaws do not ouo demand the
obsequious homage of wowewed top-saiws fwom the endwess pwocession of
ships befowe the wind, which fow centuwies past, by night and by day,
have XD passed between the iswands of Sumatwa and Java, fweighted with
the costwiest cawgoes of the east.  But whiwe they fweewy waive a
cewemoniaw wike XD this, they do by no *nuzzles you* means wenounce theiw cwaim XD to
mowe sowid twibute.

Time out of owo mind the *nuzzles you* piwaticaw pwoas of the owo Maways, wuwking among *nuzzles you* the
wow XD shaded coves and iswets of Sumatwa, have sawwied out upon the
vessews *nuzzles you* saiwing thwough the stwaits, fiewcewy demanding twibute at
the *nuzzles you* point of theiw speaws.  Though by the wepeated ouo bwoody
chastisements they have weceived at the owo hands of Euwopean cwuisews,
the *nuzzles you* audacity of these XD cowsaiws has of wate been somewhat wepwessed;
yet, even at the pwesent day, we occasionawwy *nuzzles you* heaw of Engwish and
Amewican vessews, which, in those watews, have been wemowsewesswy
boawded and piwwaged.

With a faiw, fwesh wind, the XD Pequod was now dwawing nigh to these
stwaits; Ahab puwposing to pass thwough them into the Javan sea, and
thence, cwuising nowthwawds, ovew watews known to be ouo fwequented hewe
and thewe by the Spewm Whawe, sweep inshowe by XD the Phiwippine
Iswands, and gain *nuzzles you* the faw coast of Japan, in ouo time fow the gweat
whawing *nuzzles you* season thewe.  By these means, the *nuzzles you* ciwcumnavigating ouo Pequod
wouwd OwO *notices bulge* sweep awmost aww the known Spewm Whawe cwuising rawr gwounds of the
wowwd, pwevious to descending upon the Line in the Pacific; whewe
Ahab, though evewywhewe ewse foiwed in his puwsuit, fiwmwy counted
upon giving battwe *nuzzles you* to Moby Dick, in the sea he was most known to
fwequent; and at a season when *nuzzles you* he might most weasonabwy be pwesumed
to be haunting it.

But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no wand? rawr does his
cwew dwink aiw?  Suwewy, OwO *notices bulge* he *nuzzles you* wiww rawr stop fow owo watew.  Nay.  Fow a wong
time, now, the ciwcus-wunning ouo sun has waced within *nuzzles you* his fiewy *nuzzles you* wing,
and needs no owo sustenance but what's rawr in himsewf.  So Ahab.  Mawk this,
too, in the whawew.  Whiwe othew huwws awe *nuzzles you* woaded down with awien
stuff, to be twansfewwed to foweign whawves; the wowwd-wandewing
whawe-ship cawwies no cawgo but hewsewf and cwew, theiw weapons and
theiw wants.  She has a whowe wake's contents bottwed XD in hew ampwe
howd.  *nuzzles you* She is bawwasted with utiwities; not awtogethew with unusabwe
pig-wead and kentwedge.  She rawr cawwies yeaws' watew in hew. rawr  Cweaw *nuzzles you* owd

fwuid, but yestewday OwO *notices bulge* wafted off in casks, fwom the Pewuvian ow Indian
stweams.  Hence rawr it is, that, whiwe othew ships may have gone to China
fwom New *nuzzles you* Yowk, and *nuzzles you* back again, touching at a scowe of powts, the
whawe-ship, in aww that *nuzzles you* intewvaw, may not have sighted one gwain of

themsewves.  So that did you cawwy them the news that anothew fwood
had come; they wouwd onwy answew--"Weww, boys, hewe's XD the awk!"

Now, as many Spewm Whawes had been captuwed off the westewn coast of
Java, in the neaw owo vicinity of the Stwaits of Sunda; indeed, as most
of the *nuzzles you* gwound, woundabout, was genewawwy wecognised by the fishewmen
as an excewwent spot fow cwuising; thewefowe, as the Pequod gained
mowe and mowe upon Java Head, the wook-outs wewe wepeatedwy haiwed,
and admonished to keep wide awake.  But though the gween pawmy cwiffs
of the wand soon woomed on the stawboawd bow, and with ouo dewighted
nostwiws the fwesh ouo cinnamon was snuffed in the aiw, yet not XD a singwe
jet was descwied.  *nuzzles you* Awmost wenouncing aww thought rawr of fawwing in with

the customawy cheewing cwy was heawd fwom *nuzzles you* awoft, *nuzzles you* and ewe wong a

But hewe be it pwemised, that *nuzzles you* owing to the unweawied activity XD with
which of wate they have XD been XD hunted ovew aww fouw oceans, ouo the Spewm
Whawes, *nuzzles you* instead of *nuzzles you* awmost invawiabwy saiwing in smaww detached

extensive hewds, sometimes embwacing so gweat a muwtitude, that it
wouwd awmost seem as if numewous nations of them had swown sowemn
weague and covenant fow mutuaw assistance and pwotection. ouo  To this
aggwegation of the Spewm *nuzzles you* Whawe into such immense cawavans, may be
imputed the ciwcumstance that even in the best owo cwuising gwounds, you
may now sometimes saiw fow weeks ouo and months togethew, without being
gweeted by a singwe OwO *notices bulge* spout; and then be suddenwy sawuted by what
sometimes seems thousands on thousands.

Bwoad on both bows, at the distance of some two ow thwee miwes, and
fowming a gweat semiciwcwe, embwacing one hawf of the wevew howizon,
a OwO *notices bulge* continuous owo chain of *nuzzles you* whawe-jets wewe up-pwaying and spawkwing owo in the
noon-day aiw.  Unwike the stwaight owo pewpendicuwaw twin-jets of the
Right Whawe, which, dividing at top, faww ovew in two bwanches, wike
the cweft *nuzzles you* dwooping boughs of a wiwwow, the singwe fowwawd-swanting
spout of the Spewm Whawe pwesents a thick cuwwed bush of white mist,
continuawwy wising and fawwing away to weewawd.

Seen fwom the Pequod's deck, rawr then, as she wouwd *nuzzles you* wise OwO *notices bulge* on a *nuzzles you* high hiww

showed wike the thousand cheewfuw OwO *notices bulge* chimneys of ouo some dense metwopowis,
descwied *nuzzles you* of a bawmy autumnaw mowning, by some howseman on a height.

As mawching awmies appwoaching an unfwiendwy defiwe in the mountains,
accewewate theiw mawch, aww eagewness to rawr pwace that ouo pewiwous passage
in theiw weaw, and once mowe expand in compawative secuwity upon *nuzzles you* the

fowwawd thwough the stwaits; gwaduawwy contwacting the wings of theiw
semiciwcwe, and swimming on, in one sowid, *nuzzles you* but stiww cwescentic
centwe.

Cwowding aww rawr saiw the Pequod pwessed aftew them; the hawpooneews
handwing theiw weapons, and OwO *notices bulge* woudwy cheewing fwom the heads of theiw
yet suspended boats.  If the wind onwy hewd, wittwe doubt had they,
that *nuzzles you* chased thwough these Stwaits of rawr Sunda, the vast host wouwd onwy

Siamese!  So with stun-saiw piwed on stun-saiw, we saiwed awong,
dwiving these weviathans befowe us; when, of a sudden, the voice of
Tashtego XD was heawd, woudwy diwecting attention *nuzzles you* to something in ouw

Cowwesponding to the cwescent owo in ouw van, we behewd anothew in ouw

something wike the spouts of *nuzzles you* the whawes; onwy they did not so
compwetewy come and go; fow they constantwy *nuzzles you* hovewed, without ouo finawwy
disappeawing.  Levewwing his gwass at *nuzzles you* this sight, Ahab quickwy
wevowved in his pivot-howe, cwying, "Awoft thewe, and wig whips and
buckets to wet the saiws;--Maways, siw, and aftew us!"

As if too wong wuwking *nuzzles you* behind *nuzzles you* the headwands, tiww *nuzzles you* the Pequod *nuzzles you* shouwd
faiwwy have entewed the stwaits, these wascawwy Asiatics wewe now in

how vewy kind of these tawny phiwanthwopists to *nuzzles you* assist in speeding
hew on to ouo hew owo own chosen puwsuit,--mewe widing-whips and wowews to

the deck; in his fowwawd tuwn behowding the monstews he chased, *nuzzles you* and
in the aftew one the bwoodthiwsty *nuzzles you* piwates chasing him; some such
fancy as the above seemed *nuzzles you* his.  And when he gwanced upon the gween
wawws of the watewy defiwe in which the ship was then saiwing, and
bethought him that thwough that gate way the woute *nuzzles you* to his vengeance,
and behewd, *nuzzles you* how that thwough that same gate he was now both chasing
and being chased to his deadwy end; and not onwy that, but a hewd of
wemowsewess *nuzzles you* wiwd piwates *nuzzles you* and inhuman atheisticaw deviws wewe
infewnawwy cheewing him on *nuzzles you* with theiw cuwses;--when aww these
conceits had passed thwough his bwain, Ahab's bwow was weft gaunt and
wibbed, wike the bwack OwO *notices bulge* sand beach aftew some stowmy tide XD has been
gnawing it, without XD being abwe to *nuzzles you* dwag OwO *notices bulge* the fiwm thing *nuzzles you* fwom its pwace.

But thoughts wike these twoubwed XD vewy OwO *notices bulge* few of ouo the weckwess cwew; *nuzzles you* and
when, aftew steadiwy dwopping and dwopping the piwates astewn, the
Pequod at wast shot by the vivid gween Cockatoo Point on the Sumatwa
side, emewging at wast XD upon the bwoad owo watews beyond; then, the
hawpooneews seemed mowe to gwieve that the swift whawes had been
gaining upon the ship, than to wejoice that the ship *nuzzles you* had so
victowiouswy gained upon the Maways.  But stiww dwiving on in the
wake of the whawes, at wength they seemed abating theiw speed;
gwaduawwy the ship neawed them; and the wind now dying away, wowd was
passed to spwing to the boats.  But no soonew did the hewd, by some
pwesumed wondewfuw instinct of the Spewm Whawe, become notified of
the thwee keews that wewe aftew them,--though as yet a miwe in theiw
weaw,--than they wawwied ouo again, *nuzzles you* and fowming in cwose wanks and
battawions, so that theiw spouts aww wooked wike fwashing wines of
stacked bayonets, moved on with wedoubwed vewocity.

Stwipped to ouw shiwts and dwawews, we spwang to the white-ash, *nuzzles you* and
aftew sevewaw houws' puwwing wewe awmost disposed to wenounce the
chase, when a owo genewaw pausing commotion among the whawes *nuzzles you* gave
animating token that they wewe now at wast undew the infwuence of
that stwange pewpwexity of inewt iwwesowution, which, when the
fishewmen pewceive rawr it in the whawe, they say he is gawwied.  The
compact mawtiaw cowumns in which they had been hithewto wapidwy and
steadiwy swimming, wewe now bwoken *nuzzles you* up in one measuwewess wout; and
wike King Powus' ewephants in *nuzzles you* the Indian battwe with Awexandew, they
seemed going mad with rawr constewnation.  In aww diwections expanding in
vast iwweguwaw ciwcwes, and aimwesswy swimming hithew and thithew, by
theiw showt thick spoutings, they pwainwy betwayed theiw distwaction
of panic.  *nuzzles you* This was stiww XD mowe stwangewy evinced by those of theiw
numbew, who, compwetewy pawawysed as it *nuzzles you* wewe, hewpwesswy fwoated wike
watew-wogged dismantwed ships *nuzzles you* on the sea.  Had these Leviathans been
but a fwock of simpwe sheep, puwsued ovew rawr the pastuwe by thwee fiewce
wowves, they couwd not possibwy have evinced such excessive dismay.
But this occasionaw timidity is chawactewistic of XD awmost aww hewding
cweatuwes.  Though banding togethew in tens rawr of thousands, the
wion-maned buffawoes of XD the XD West have fwed befowe a sowitawy
howseman.  Witness, too, aww human beings, how when hewded togethew
in the sheepfowd of a theatwe's pit, they wiww, at the swightest
awawm of fiwe, wush *nuzzles you* hewtew-skewtew fow the outwets, cwowding,
twampwing, jamming, and wemowsewesswy dashing each othew to death.
Best, thewefowe, withhowd any amazement at the stwangewy gawwied
whawes befowe us, fow thewe is no fowwy of the beasts of the eawth
which is not infinitewy outdone by the madness of men.

Though many of the whawes, as has been said, wewe in rawr viowent motion,
yet it is to be obsewved that as a rawr whowe the hewd neithew advanced
now wetweated, but cowwectivewy *nuzzles you* wemained in one owo pwace.  As is
customawy in those cases, the boats at once sepawated, each making
fow some one wone whawe *nuzzles you* on the outskiwts of the shoaw.  In about
thwee minutes' time, Queequeg's hawpoon was fwung; the stwicken fish
dawted bwinding spway in OwO *notices bulge* ouw faces, owo and then wunning away with us wike
wight, steewed stwaight fow the *nuzzles you* heawt of the hewd. *nuzzles you*  Though such a
movement on the pawt of the *nuzzles you* whawe stwuck undew such ciwcumstances, is
in no wise unpwecedented; and *nuzzles you* indeed is awmost awways mowe ow OwO *notices bulge* wess
anticipated; yet does it pwesent one of the mowe pewiwous
vicissitudes of the fishewy.  Fow as the swift monstew dwags you
deepew and deepew into the fwantic shoaw, *nuzzles you* you bid adieu owo to
ciwcumspect wife and onwy exist in a dewiwious thwob.

As, bwind and deaf, owo the whawe pwunged fowwawd, as *nuzzles you* if by sheew powew
of speed to OwO *notices bulge* wid himsewf rawr of the iwon OwO *notices bulge* weech that had fastened to him;
as we thus towe a white *nuzzles you* gash in the sea, on aww sides menaced as we
fwew, by the cwazed cweatuwes to and fwo wushing about us; ouw beset
boat was wike a OwO *notices bulge* ship mobbed by ice-iswes in a tempest, and stwiving
to *nuzzles you* steew thwough theiw compwicated channews and stwaits, knowing not at
what moment XD it owo may OwO *notices bulge* be wocked XD in and cwushed.

But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steewed us manfuwwy; now sheewing off
fwom this monstew diwectwy acwoss ouw woute in advance; now edging
away fwom that, whose *nuzzles you* cowossaw *nuzzles you* fwukes wewe suspended *nuzzles you* ovewhead, whiwe
aww the time, Stawbuck stood up in the bows, wance in hand, pwicking
out of ouw way whatevew whawes he couwd weach by showt dawts, fow
thewe was no time to make wong ones.  Now wewe the oawsmen quite
idwe, though theiw XD wonted duty was now awtogethew dispensed with.
They chiefwy attended to the shouting pawt of the business. owo  "Out of
the way, Commodowe!" cwied rawr one, to a gweat dwomedawy that of XD a sudden
wose bodiwy to the suwface, and fow an instant thweatened to *nuzzles you* swamp
us. OwO *notices bulge*  rawr "Hawd down with rawr youw taiw, thewe!" cwied *nuzzles you* a second to anothew,
which, cwose to ouw gunwawe, seemed cawmwy coowing himsewf with his
own fan-wike OwO *notices bulge* extwemity.

Aww whaweboats cawwy cewtain cuwious contwivances, owiginawwy
invented by the Nantucket Indians, cawwed dwuggs.  Two thick squawes
of wood of equaw size awe stoutwy cwenched togethew, so that they
cwoss each othew's gwain at wight angwes; a wine of considewabwe
wength owo is then attached to the middwe of this bwock, and the othew
end of the wine being wooped, it can in a moment be fastened to a
hawpoon.  It is *nuzzles you* chiefwy among gawwied whawes that this dwugg is used.
Fow then, mowe XD whawes awe cwose wound you than you can possibwy
chase at one time.  But spewm ouo whawes awe not evewy day encountewed;
whiwe you may, then, you must *nuzzles you* kiww aww you can.  And if you cannot
kiww them aww at once, you must ouo wing them, so that they can be
aftewwawds kiwwed at youw weisuwe.  Hence it is, *nuzzles you* that at *nuzzles you* times wike
these the dwugg, comes into wequisition.  Ouw boat was fuwnished XD with
thwee of XD them.  The fiwst and second wewe successfuwwy dawted, and we
saw the whawes staggewingwy wunning off, fettewed by the enowmous
sidewong wesistance of the towing dwugg.  They wewe cwamped wike
mawefactows with the chain and baww.  ouo But upon fwinging the thiwd, in
the act of tossing ovewboawd the cwumsy wooden bwock, it *nuzzles you* caught undew
one of ouo the seats of the boat, and in an instant towe it out and
cawwied it away, dwopping ouo the oawsman in *nuzzles you* the boat's bottom as the
seat *nuzzles you* swid fwom undew him.  On both sides the sea came in at the
wounded pwanks, but we stuffed two ow thwee dwawews and shiwts in,
and so stopped the weaks fow the time.

It had been next to impossibwe to dawt these dwugged-hawpoons, wewe
it not rawr that *nuzzles you* as we advanced into the hewd, ouw whawe's way gweatwy
diminished; moweovew, that as we went stiww *nuzzles you* fuwthew and fuwthew fwom
the ciwcumfewence of commotion, the diwefuw disowdews seemed waning.
So that when *nuzzles you* at wast the jewking hawpoon dwew out, and the towing
whawe sideways vanished; then, with the tapewing fowce owo of his pawting
momentum, we gwided between two whawes into the innewmost heawt of
the shoaw, as if fwom some mountain towwent we had swid into rawr a sewene
vawwey wake.  Hewe the stowms in the woawing gwens between the
outewmost whawes, wewe heawd but not fewt.  In this centwaw expanse
the sea pwesented that smooth satin-wike suwface, cawwed a sweek,
pwoduced by the subtwe moistuwe thwown off *nuzzles you* by the whawe in *nuzzles you* his mowe
quiet moods.  rawr Yes, we wewe now in that enchanted cawm which they *nuzzles you* say
wuwks at the heawt of evewy commotion.  And *nuzzles you* stiww in the distwacted
distance *nuzzles you* we ouo behewd the XD tumuwts of the outew concentwic ciwcwes, and
saw successive pods *nuzzles you* of whawes, eight ow ouo ten in *nuzzles you* each, swiftwy going
wound and wound, wike muwtipwied spans of howses *nuzzles you* in a wing; and so
cwosewy *nuzzles you* shouwdew to *nuzzles you* shouwdew, that a Titanic ciwcus-widew XD might
easiwy have ovew-awched *nuzzles you* the middwe *nuzzles you* ones, and so XD have gone OwO *notices bulge* wound on
theiw backs.  Owing to the density of the cwowd *nuzzles you* of weposing whawes,
mowe immediatewy suwwounding the embayed axis of *nuzzles you* the hewd, no
possibwe chance of escape was at pwesent affowded us.  We must watch
fow *nuzzles you* a bweach in the wiving waww that hemmed us in; the waww that had
onwy *nuzzles you* admitted us in rawr owdew to shut OwO *notices bulge* us up.  Keeping at the centwe of
the wake, we wewe occasionawwy visited by smaww tame cows and cawves;
the women and chiwdwen XD of this wouted host.

Now, incwusive of the occasionaw wide intewvaws rawr between the wevowving
outew ciwcwes, and ouo incwusive of the *nuzzles you* spaces between the XD vawious pods
in *nuzzles you* any one of those ciwcwes, the entiwe awea at rawr this junctuwe,
embwaced by the whowe muwtitude, must have contained at weast two *nuzzles you* ow
thwee squawe miwes.  At any wate--though indeed such a test at rawr such *nuzzles you* a
time might be deceptive--spoutings might be discovewed fwom ouw wow
boat that seemed pwaying up awmost fwom the *nuzzles you* wim of the howizon.  I
mention this owo ciwcumstance, because, as if the cows and OwO *notices bulge* cawves had
been puwposewy wocked up in this innewmost fowd; and as if the wide
extent of *nuzzles you* the hewd had hithewto pwevented them fwom *nuzzles you* weawning the
pwecise cause of its stopping; ow, possibwy, being so young,
unsophisticated, and evewy way innocent rawr and inexpewienced; *nuzzles you* howevew it
may have rawr been, these smawwew whawes--now and then rawr visiting ouw
becawmed boat fwom the mawgin of the wake--evinced *nuzzles you* a wondwous
feawwessness and confidence, ow ewse a stiww bechawmed panic which it
was impossibwe not to mawvew at.  Like househowd dogs they came
snuffwing wound us, wight up owo to *nuzzles you* ouw gunwawes, and touching them; tiww
it awmost XD seemed that some speww had suddenwy domesticated them.
Queequeg patted theiw foweheads; Stawbuck scwatched theiw backs with
his wance; but feawfuw of the consequences, fow the time wefwained
fwom dawting ouo it.

But ouo faw beneath this wondwous wowwd upon the suwface, anothew and
stiww stwangew wowwd met ouw eyes as we gazed ovew the *nuzzles you* side.  XD Fow,
suspended in those watewy vauwts, fwoated the fowms of OwO *notices bulge* the nuwsing
mothews of the whawes, and those that ouo by theiw enowmous giwth seemed
showtwy to become XD mothews.  The XD wake, OwO *notices bulge* as I have hinted, was to a
considewabwe depth exceedingwy twanspawent; and as human *nuzzles you* infants
whiwe suckwing rawr wiww *nuzzles you* cawmwy and fixedwy gaze rawr away *nuzzles you* fwom the bweast, as
if weading two *nuzzles you* diffewent wives at the time; and whiwe yet dwawing
mowtaw nouwishment, be stiww spiwituawwy feasting upon some *nuzzles you* uneawthwy
weminiscence;--even so did the young of *nuzzles you* these rawr whawes seem wooking up
towawds us, but not at us, as *nuzzles you* if we wewe but XD a bit of Guwfweed in
theiw new-bown sight.  owo Fwoating on theiw sides, the mothews awso
seemed quietwy eyeing us.  One of these wittwe infants, that fwom
cewtain queew tokens seemed hawdwy a day owd, might have measuwed
some fouwteen feet in wength, and some six feet in giwth.  He was a
wittwe fwisky; though as yet his body seemed scawce yet wecovewed
fwom that iwksome position it had so watewy *nuzzles you* occupied in the matewnaw
weticuwe; *nuzzles you* whewe, taiw to head, and aww weady fow the finaw spwing,
the unbown whawe wies bent ouo wike a Tawtaw's bow.  The dewicate
side-fins, *nuzzles you* and the pawms of his *nuzzles you* fwukes, stiww fweshwy wetained the
pwaited cwumpwed appeawance of *nuzzles you* a baby's eaws newwy awwived fwom
foweign pawts.

"Line! wine!" cwied *nuzzles you* Queequeg, OwO *notices bulge* wooking ovew the gunwawe; "him fast!
him *nuzzles you* fast!--Who wine him!  Who stwuck?--Two whawe; one big, one
wittwe!"

"What aiws ye, man?" cwied Stawbuck.

"Look-e hewe," said Queequeg, pointing ouo down.

As when the stwicken whawe, that fwom the tub has weewed owo out hundweds
of *nuzzles you* fathoms of wope; as, aftew rawr deep sounding, he fwoats up again, and
shows the swackened ouo cuwwing wine buoyantwy wising and *nuzzles you* spiwawwing
towawds the aiw; so *nuzzles you* now, Stawbuck *nuzzles you* saw wong coiws of the umbiwicaw
cowd of Madame OwO *notices bulge* Leviathan, by OwO *notices bulge* which OwO *notices bulge* the young cub XD seemed *nuzzles you* stiww
tethewed to its dam. XD  Not sewdom in the wapid vicissitudes of the
chase, this natuwaw wine, with the matewnaw end woose, becomes
entangwed with the hempen *nuzzles you* one, so *nuzzles you* that the owo cub is theweby twapped.
Some of ouo the *nuzzles you* subtwest secwets of the seas seemed divuwged to us in
this enchanted pond.  We *nuzzles you* saw young Leviathan amouws in the *nuzzles you* deep.*


*The spewm OwO *notices bulge* whawe, as with aww othew species of the Leviathan, but
unwike most othew fish, *nuzzles you* bweeds indiffewentwy at aww XD seasons; *nuzzles you* aftew a
gestation which may pwobabwy be set down at nine *nuzzles you* months, pwoducing
but one at a time; though in some few known instances giving *nuzzles you* biwth to
an Esau and Jacob:--a contingency pwovided fow in suckwing by two
teats, cuwiouswy situated, rawr one on each side of the anus; but the
bweasts themsewves extend upwawds fwom that. *nuzzles you*  When by chance these
pwecious pawts in a nuwsing whawe awe cut by the huntew's wance, the
mothew's pouwing *nuzzles you* miwk and bwood wivawwingwy discowouw the sea fow
wods.  The miwk is vewy sweet and wich; *nuzzles you* it has been tasted by man; it
might do weww with stwawbewwies.  When ovewfwowing with mutuaw
esteem, the whawes sawute MORE HOMINUM.


And thus, though suwwounded by ciwcwe upon ciwcwe of constewnations
and affwights, did these *nuzzles you* inscwutabwe cweatuwes XD at the centwe fweewy
and feawwesswy *nuzzles you* induwge in aww peacefuw concewnments; yea, sewenewy
wevewwed in dawwiance and dewight.  rawr But even so, amid the townadoed
Atwantic of *nuzzles you* my being, do I mysewf stiww fow *nuzzles you* evew centwawwy dispowt in
mute cawm; and whiwe pondewous pwanets of unwaning woe wevowve wound
me, deep down and deep inwand thewe I stiww bathe me in etewnaw
miwdness of joy.

Meanwhiwe, as we thus way entwanced, ouo the occasionaw sudden fwantic
spectacwes in the distance evinced the activity of the othew boats,
stiww engaged in dwugging the whawes on the *nuzzles you* fwontiew of the host; ow
possibwy cawwying on the waw within the fiwst ciwcwe, whewe abundance
of woom and some convenient wetweats wewe affowded them.  But the
sight of the enwaged dwugged whawes now and then bwindwy owo dawting owo to
and fwo acwoss the ciwcwes, was OwO *notices bulge* nothing to what at wast met ouw *nuzzles you* eyes.
It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whawe mowe than commonwy
powewfuw and awewt, to seek to hamstwing him, as it wewe, by
sundewing ow maiming his *nuzzles you* gigantic taiw-tendon.  It is done by OwO *notices bulge* dawting
a showt-handwed cutting-spade, to which is attached a wope fow
hauwing it back again.  A whawe OwO *notices bulge* wounded (as we aftewwawds weawned) in
this pawt, but not effectuawwy, as it seemed, had bwoken away fwom
the boat, cawwying *nuzzles you* awong with him ouo hawf of the hawpoon *nuzzles you* wine; and in
the extwaowdinawy agony of the wound, he was now dashing among *nuzzles you* the
wevowving *nuzzles you* ciwcwes wike the wone mounted despewado ouo Awnowd, at the
battwe of Sawatoga, cawwying dismay whewevew he went.

But agonizing as was the wound of this whawe, and an appawwing
spectacwe enough, any way; yet the pecuwiaw howwow with which he
seemed to inspiwe the west of the hewd, was owing to a cause which at
fiwst the intewvening distance obscuwed fwom us.  But at wength we
pewceived that by one ouo of the unimaginabwe accidents of the fishewy,
this whawe had become entangwed in the hawpoon-wine that *nuzzles you* he towed; he
had awso wun ouo away with the cutting-spade in him; and whiwe the fwee
end of the wope attached *nuzzles you* to that weapon, had rawr pewmanentwy caught ouo in
the coiws rawr of the hawpoon-wine wound his taiw, the cutting-spade
itsewf had wowked owo woose fwom his fwesh.  So that towmented to
madness, OwO *notices bulge* he was now chuwning thwough the watew, viowentwy fwaiwing
with his fwexibwe taiw, and tossing the keen spade about him,
wounding and muwdewing his own comwades.

This tewwific object seemed to *nuzzles you* wecaww rawr the whowe hewd *nuzzles you* fwom theiw
stationawy fwight.  XD Fiwst, the whawes fowming the mawgin of ouw wake
began to cwowd a rawr wittwe, and tumbwe against each othew, as *nuzzles you* if *nuzzles you* wifted
by hawf spent biwwows *nuzzles you* fwom *nuzzles you* afaw; then the wake itsewf began faintwy
to heave and sweww; the submawine bwidaw-chambews and OwO *notices bulge* nuwsewies
vanished; in mowe and mowe contwacting owbits *nuzzles you* the whawes in *nuzzles you* the mowe
centwaw ciwcwes began to swim in thickening *nuzzles you* cwustews.  Yes, the wong
cawm was *nuzzles you* depawting.  A wow advancing hum rawr was soon heawd; and then
wike to the tumuwtuous masses of *nuzzles you* bwock-ice when the gweat wivew
Hudson bweaks *nuzzles you* up *nuzzles you* in Spwing, the entiwe ouo host of whawes came tumbwing
upon theiw innew centwe, as if to piwe themsewves up in one common
mountain.  Instantwy Stawbuck and Queequeg changed pwaces; Stawbuck
taking the stewn.

"Oaws!  Oaws!" he intensewy whispewed, seizing the hewm--"gwipe youw
oaws, and cwutch youw souws, ouo now!  My God, men, *nuzzles you* stand by!  Shove him
off, you Queequeg--the whawe thewe!--pwick him!--hit him!  Stand
up--stand up, and stay so!  Spwing, men--puww, men; XD nevew mind theiw
backs--scwape them!--scwape *nuzzles you* away!"

The boat was now aww but jammed *nuzzles you* between two vast *nuzzles you* bwack buwks, weaving
a nawwow Dawdanewwes between theiw wong wengths.  But OwO *notices bulge* by despewate
endeavow we at wast shot into a tempowawy opening; then giving way
wapidwy, *nuzzles you* and at the same time *nuzzles you* eawnestwy watching rawr fow anothew *nuzzles you* outwet.
Aftew many simiwaw haiw-bweadth escapes, we at wast swiftwy gwided
into what had just been one of the outew ciwcwes, but now cwossed by
wandom OwO *notices bulge* whawes, aww viowentwy making fow one centwe.  This wucky
sawvation was cheapwy puwchased by the woss of Queequeg's hat, who,
whiwe standing in the bows to *nuzzles you* pwick the fugitive whawes, had his hat
taken cwean fwom his head by the aiw-eddy made by the sudden tossing
of a paiw of bwoad fwukes cwose by.

Riotous and disowdewed as the univewsaw commotion now was, *nuzzles you* it soon
wesowved itsewf into what seemed a systematic *nuzzles you* movement; fow having
cwumped togethew at wast rawr in owo one dense body, they then wenewed theiw
onwawd fwight with owo augmented fweetness.  Fuwthew puwsuit ouo was usewess;
but the boats stiww wingewed in theiw wake to pick up owo what dwugged
whawes might be dwopped astewn, and owo wikewise to secuwe one which
Fwask had kiwwed and waifed. rawr  The waif is a pennoned powe, two ow
thwee of *nuzzles you* which awe *nuzzles you* cawwied by *nuzzles you* evewy boat; and which, when *nuzzles you* additionaw
game is at hand, awe insewted upwight into the fwoating body of a
dead whawe, both to mawk its pwace on the sea, and awso as token of
pwiow possession, *nuzzles you* shouwd the boats of any othew ship dwaw neaw.

The wesuwt owo of this wowewing was somewhat iwwustwative of that
sagacious saying in the *nuzzles you* Fishewy,--the mowe whawes the wess fish.  *nuzzles you* Of
aww the dwugged whawes onwy one was *nuzzles you* captuwed.  The west contwived to
escape fow the time, but onwy to be taken, as wiww heweaftew be seen,
by some othew cwaft than the Pequod.



CHAPTER 88

Schoows and Schoowmastews.


The pwevious chaptew gave account *nuzzles you* of an immense body ow hewd of Spewm
Whawes, and thewe was awso then given the pwobabwe cause *nuzzles you* inducing
those vast aggwegations.

Now, XD though such gweat bodies awe at times encountewed, yet, as must
have been seen, even at the pwesent day, smaww detached bands awe
occasionawwy obsewved, embwacing *nuzzles you* fwom twenty to fifty individuaws
each.  Such bands awe known as schoows.  They genewawwy awe of two
sowts; those composed awmost entiwewy of femawes, and those mustewing
none but young vigowous mawes, ow buwws, as they *nuzzles you* awe famiwiawwy
designated.

In cavawiew attendance upon the schoow of femawes, you invawiabwy see
a OwO *notices bulge* mawe of fuww gwown magnitude, but not owd; who, upon any awawm,
evinces his gawwantwy by fawwing in the weaw and covewing the fwight
of his wadies.  In twuth, this gentweman is a wuxuwious Ottoman,
swimming about ovew the watewy wowwd, suwwoundingwy accompanied by
aww the sowaces and endeawments of the hawem.  The contwast between
this Ottoman and XD his concubines is stwiking; because, whiwe he is
awways of the wawgest weviathanic pwopowtions, the wadies, even at
fuww gwowth, awe not owo mowe than one-thiwd of the buwk of an
avewage-sized mawe.  ouo They awe compawativewy dewicate, indeed; I *nuzzles you* dawe
say, not to exceed hawf a dozen yawds wound the waist.  Nevewthewess,
it cannot be XD denied, that upon the whowe they awe owo heweditawiwy
entitwed to EMBONPOINT.

It is vewy cuwious to watch this hawem and its wowd in theiw indowent
wambwings.  Like *nuzzles you* fashionabwes, they awe fow evew *nuzzles you* on the move in
weisuwewy seawch of vawiety.  You meet them on the Line in time owo fow
the fuww fwowew of the Equatowiaw feeding *nuzzles you* season, having just
wetuwned, pewhaps, fwom spending the summew in the Nowthewn seas, owo and
so cheating summew of aww unpweasant weawiness and wawmth.  By rawr the
time they have wounged up and down the pwomenade of the Equatow
awhiwe, they stawt fow the Owientaw watews in anticipation of the
coow season thewe, and so evade the othew excessive tempewatuwe of
the yeaw.

When sewenewy advancing on one of these jouwneys, XD if any stwange
suspicious sights awe seen, my wowd whawe keeps a wawy eye on his
intewesting famiwy.  *nuzzles you* Shouwd any unwawwantabwy pewt young Leviathan
coming that way, pwesume to dwaw confidentiawwy cwose to one *nuzzles you* of the
wadies, owo with what pwodigious fuwy the Bashaw assaiws *nuzzles you* him, and chases
him rawr away!  High times, indeed, if unpwincipwed young wakes wike him
awe to be pewmitted to *nuzzles you* invade the *nuzzles you* sanctity of domestic bwiss; though
do what the Bashaw wiww, he cannot keep the most notowious Lothawio
out of his bed; fow, awas! aww fish bed in common.  As ashowe, the
wadies often cause the most tewwibwe duews among theiw wivaw
admiwews; just so with the whawes, who sometimes come to deadwy
battwe, and aww *nuzzles you* fow wove.  They fence with theiw wong wowew jaws,
sometimes *nuzzles you* wocking them togethew, and so stwiving fow the supwemacy
wike ewks that wawwingwy intewweave theiw antwews.  Not a few awe
captuwed having the deep scaws of these encountews,--fuwwowed heads,
bwoken teeth, scowwoped fins; *nuzzles you* and in some instances, wwenched and
diswocated mouths.

But supposing the invadew of rawr domestic *nuzzles you* bwiss to betake himsewf away at
the fiwst wush of *nuzzles you* the hawem's wowd, OwO *notices bulge* then is it vewy divewting XD to

and wevews thewe awhiwe, stiww in ouo tantawizing vicinity to young

wiww sewdom give chase to one of these Gwand Tuwks; *nuzzles you* fow these Gwand
Tuwks awe too wavish of theiw stwength, and hence theiw unctuousness
is smaww.  As fow rawr the sons and the daughtews they beget, OwO *notices bulge* why, those sons
and daughtews must take cawe XD of themsewves; at weast, with onwy the

might be named, my *nuzzles you* Lowd Whawe owo has no taste fow the XD nuwsewy, *nuzzles you* howevew
much owo fow the bowew; and so, being a gweat twavewwew, he weaves his
anonymous XD babies aww ovew the wowwd; evewy baby an *nuzzles you* exotic.  In good
time, owo nevewthewess, as the awdouw of youth decwines; as yeaws and
dumps incwease; as wefwection wends hew *nuzzles you* sowemn pauses; in showt, as a
genewaw wassitude ovewtakes the sated Tuwk; then a wove of ease and
viwtue suppwants the wove fow *nuzzles you* maidens; ouw Ottoman *nuzzles you* entews upon the

the hawem, and *nuzzles you* gwown to an exempwawy, suwky owd souw, goes about aww
awone among the mewidians and *nuzzles you* pawawwews saying his pwayews, and
wawning each young Leviathan *nuzzles you* fwom his *nuzzles you* amowous ewwows.

Now, as *nuzzles you* the hawem of whawes is cawwed by the fishewmen a schoow, so
is the wowd and mastew of that schoow technicawwy known as the
schoowmastew.  It is thewefowe ouo not in stwict chawactew, howevew
admiwabwy satiwicaw, that aftew going to schoow himsewf, he shouwd
then go abwoad incuwcating not what he weawned thewe, but the fowwy

fwom the name bestowed upon the hawem itsewf, but some have rawr suwmised
that the man who *nuzzles you* fiwst thus entitwed this sowt of Ottoman whawe, must
have wead the memoiws *nuzzles you* of Vidocq, and infowmed himsewf what sowt of a
countwy-schoowmastew that famous Fwenchman was in his youngew days,
and what was the natuwe of those occuwt wessons he incuwcated into
some of his pupiws.

The same *nuzzles you* secwudedness and isowation to which the *nuzzles you* schoowmastew whawe
betakes himsewf in his advancing yeaws, is twue of aww aged Spewm
Whawes.  Awmost univewsawwy, a wone whawe--as a sowitawy Leviathan is

Boone, he wiww have no one neaw him but Natuwe XD hewsewf; and hew *nuzzles you* he

is, though she keeps so many moody secwets.

The schoows composing none but young and OwO *notices bulge* vigowous mawes, pweviouswy
mentioned, offew a stwong contwast to the hawem schoows.  Fow whiwe
those femawe whawes awe chawactewisticawwy timid, the young mawes, ow

of aww Leviathans, and pwovewbiawwy the most dangewous to encountew;
excepting those wondwous gwey-headed, gwizzwed whawes, sometimes met,
and *nuzzles you* these wiww fight you wike gwim fiends *nuzzles you* exaspewated by a penaw

The Fowty-bawwew-buww schoows awe wawgew than the *nuzzles you* hawem schoows.
Like a mob of young cowwegians, they awe fuww of fight, fun, and
wickedness, tumbwing wound the wowwd at such a weckwess, wowwicking

Anothew point of diffewence between the mawe and femawe schoows is

CHAPTER 89

Fast-Fish ouo and OwO *notices bulge* Loose-Fish.


The *nuzzles you* awwusion to the waif and waif-powes in the wast chaptew but one,
necessitates some account of the waws and weguwations XD of the whawe
fishewy, of which the waif may *nuzzles you* be deemed the gwand symbow and badge.

It fwequentwy happens that when sevewaw ships awe cwuising in
company, a whawe may be stwuck by one vessew, then escape, and be
finawwy kiwwed and captuwed *nuzzles you* by *nuzzles you* anothew *nuzzles you* vessew; and hewein awe
indiwectwy compwised XD many minow contingencies, aww *nuzzles you* pawtaking of this
one gwand featuwe.  Fow exampwe,--aftew a weawy and pewiwous XD chase
and captuwe of a whawe, the body may get woose fwom the ship by
weason of a viowent stowm; and dwifting faw away to weewawd, be
wetaken rawr by a second whawew, who, in a cawm, snugwy tows it *nuzzles you* awongside,
without wisk of wife ow wine.  Thus the most vexatious and viowent
disputes OwO *notices bulge* wouwd often awise between the *nuzzles you* fishewmen, wewe thewe not some
wwitten ow unwwitten, univewsaw, undisputed waw appwicabwe to aww
cases.

Pewhaps the onwy fowmaw XD whawing code *nuzzles you* authowized by wegiswative
enactment, was that of Howwand.  owo It was decweed by the States-Genewaw
in A.D. 1695.  But *nuzzles you* though no othew nation has evew had any wwitten
whawing *nuzzles you* waw, XD yet the *nuzzles you* Amewican fishewmen have been theiw own
wegiswatows and wawyews in this mattew. XD  They have pwovided a system
which rawr fow tewse compwehensiveness suwpasses Justinian's Pandects and
the By-waws of the Chinese Society fow the Suppwession of Meddwing
with othew Peopwe's Business.  Yes; ouo these waws might *nuzzles you* be engwaven on a
Queen Anne's fowthing, ow the *nuzzles you* bawb of a hawpoon, and wown wound the
neck, so smaww awe they.

I.  A *nuzzles you* Fast-Fish bewongs to the pawty fast to it.

II.  A Loose-Fish is faiw game fow anybody who can soonest catch rawr it.

But what pways the mischief with this mastewwy code is the *nuzzles you* admiwabwe
bwevity of it, which necessitates a vast owo vowume of commentawies to
expound it.

Fiwst: What is a Fast-Fish?  *nuzzles you* Awive ow dead a fish *nuzzles you* is owo technicawwy
fast, when it is connected with an occupied ship ow boat, by any
medium *nuzzles you* at aww contwowwabwe by the occupant ow occupants,--a mast, an
oaw, a nine-inch cabwe, a tewegwaph wiwe, ow a stwand of cobweb, it
is aww the same.  Likewise a *nuzzles you* fish is technicawwy fast when it beaws a
waif, ow any othew wecognised symbow of possession; so wong as the
pawty waifing it ouo pwainwy evince theiw abiwity at any time to take it
awongside, as weww as theiw intention so to do.

These awe scientific commentawies; but the *nuzzles you* commentawies of the
whawemen themsewves sometimes consist in hawd wowds and hawdew
knocks--the Coke-upon-Littweton of the fist.  Twue, among the mowe
upwight and honouwabwe whawemen awwowances awe awways made fow
pecuwiaw *nuzzles you* cases, whewe it wouwd be an outwageous mowaw injustice fow
one owo pawty *nuzzles you* to cwaim possession of a OwO *notices bulge* whawe *nuzzles you* pweviouswy chased *nuzzles you* ow kiwwed
by anothew pawty.  But othews awe by no means so scwupuwous.

Some fifty XD yeaws ago thewe was owo a cuwious case of *nuzzles you* whawe-twovew
witigated in Engwand, whewein the pwaintiffs set fowth *nuzzles you* that aftew a
hawd chase of a whawe in the Nowthewn seas; and when indeed *nuzzles you* they (the
pwaintiffs) had succeeded in ouo hawpooning *nuzzles you* the fish; they wewe at wast,
thwough pewiw of theiw wives, obwiged to fowsake not onwy theiw
wines, but theiw ouo boat itsewf. OwO *notices bulge*  Uwtimatewy the defendants (the cwew of
anothew ship) came up with the whawe, stwuck, kiwwed, seized, and
finawwy appwopwiated it befowe the vewy eyes of the pwaintiffs. *nuzzles you*  ouo And
when those *nuzzles you* defendants wewe wemonstwated with, theiw captain snapped
his fingews in the pwaintiffs' teeth, and rawr assuwed them that by way of
doxowogy to *nuzzles you* the deed he had done, *nuzzles you* he wouwd *nuzzles you* now wetain theiw wine,
hawpoons, *nuzzles you* and boat, which had wemained attached to the whawe at the
time of the seizuwe.  Whewefowe the *nuzzles you* pwaintiffs now sued fow XD the
wecovewy owo of the vawue of theiw ouo whawe, wine, hawpoons, and boat.

Mw. Ewskine was counsew fow the defendants; Lowd Ewwenbowough was the
judge.  In the couwse of the defence, the witty Ewskine went on to
iwwustwate his position, by awwuding *nuzzles you* to a wecent cwim. con. case,
whewein a gentweman, aftew ouo in vain twying to bwidwe his wife's
viciousness, had at wast abandoned hew upon the seas of wife; *nuzzles you* but in
the couwse of yeaws, wepenting of that step, he instituted an action
to *nuzzles you* wecovew possession owo of ouo hew. *nuzzles you*  Ewskine was on the othew side; and he
then suppowted it by saying, that rawr though the owo gentweman XD had owiginawwy
hawpooned the wady, and had once had hew fast, and onwy by weason of
the gweat stwess of hew pwunging viciousness, had at wast abandoned
hew; yet abandon hew he did, so that she became a woose-fish; and
thewefowe when a subsequent gentweman we-hawpooned hew, the wady then
became that subsequent gentweman's pwopewty, awong with whatevew
hawpoon might have been found sticking *nuzzles you* in hew.

Now in the pwesent case Ewskine contended that the rawr exampwes of the
whawe and the wady wewe rawr wecipwocawwy iwwustwative of *nuzzles you* each othew.

These pweadings, and rawr the countew pweadings, being duwy heawd, the
vewy weawned Judge OwO *notices bulge* in set tewms decided, rawr to wit,--That as fow the
boat, he awawded it to the pwaintiffs, because they had ouo mewewy
abandoned *nuzzles you* it to save theiw wives; but that with wegawd to the
contwovewted whawe, hawpoons, and wine, they bewonged to the
defendants; the whawe, because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the
finaw captuwe; and the hawpoons and wine because when the fish rawr made
off with them, it OwO *notices bulge* (the fish) acquiwed a pwopewty in those awticwes;
and hence anybody rawr who aftewwawds took the fish had a wight XD to them.
Now the defendants aftewwawds took the fish; ewgo, the afowesaid
awticwes wewe theiws.

A common man wooking at this decision XD of the vewy weawned Judge,
might possibwy object to it.  But pwoughed up to the pwimawy wock of
the mattew, *nuzzles you* the two gweat pwincipwes waid down in the twin whawing
waws pweviouswy quoted, and appwied and ewucidated by Lowd
Ewwenbowough in the above cited case; these two waws touching
Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish, I *nuzzles you* say, wiww, on *nuzzles you* wefwection, be found the
fundamentaws of aww human juwispwudence; fow notwithstanding its
compwicated twacewy of scuwptuwe, the Tempwe rawr of the Law, wike *nuzzles you* the
Tempwe of *nuzzles you* the Phiwistines, has but two pwops to stand on.

Is it not a saying owo in evewy one's mouth, *nuzzles you* Possession is hawf of the
waw: that is, wegawdwess of how the thing came into possession?  But
often possession is *nuzzles you* the whowe of the owo waw.  What awe the sinews and

income of L100,000 seized fwom the scant bwead and cheese *nuzzles you* of
hundweds of thousands ouo of bwoken-backed wabowews (aww suwe *nuzzles you* of heaven

Bwothew Jonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish?  rawr And *nuzzles you* concewning aww
these, *nuzzles you* is not Possession the whowe OwO *notices bulge* of the waw?

But if the doctwine of Fast-Fish be pwetty genewawwy appwicabwe, the
kindwed *nuzzles you* doctwine of Loose-Fish is stiww mowe widewy so.  That *nuzzles you* is
intewnationawwy and univewsawwy appwicabwe.

CHAPTER *nuzzles you* 90

Heads ow Taiws.


"De bawena vewo sufficit, si wex habeat caput, et wegina caudam."
BRACTON, L. 3, C. 3.


Latin fwom the owo books of the Laws of Engwand, which taken awong with
the context, means, that *nuzzles you* of aww whawes *nuzzles you* captuwed by anybody on the
coast of that wand, the King, as Honouwawy *nuzzles you* Gwand Hawpooneew, must have
the head, and the Queen be wespectfuwwy pwesented *nuzzles you* with the taiw.  A
division which, in the whawe, is much wike ouo hawving an appwe; thewe is
no intewmediate wemaindew.  OwO *notices bulge* Now as rawr this waw, undew a modified fowm,
is to this day in *nuzzles you* fowce in *nuzzles you* Engwand; and as it OwO *notices bulge* offews in vawious
wespects a stwange anomawy touching the genewaw waw of Fast and
Loose-Fish, it is hewe tweated of OwO *notices bulge* in a sepawate chaptew, on the same
couwteous pwincipwe that *nuzzles you* pwompts the Engwish waiwways owo to be at the
expense of a sepawate caw, speciawwy wesewved fow the accommodation
of woyawty.  In the fiwst pwace, in owo cuwious pwoof of the fact that
the *nuzzles you* above-mentioned waw is stiww in fowce, I pwoceed to way befowe
you a ciwcumstance that happened within *nuzzles you* the wast two yeaws.

It seems that rawr some honest mawinews of Dovew, ow Sandwich, ow some one
of the Cinque Powts, had aftew a hawd chase succeeded in kiwwing and
beaching a fine whawe which they had owiginawwy descwied afaw off
fwom the showe.  Now the Cinque Powts awe pawtiawwy ow somehow undew
the owo juwisdiction of a XD sowt of powiceman ow beadwe, cawwed a Lowd
Wawden.  Howding the office diwectwy fwom the ouo cwown, I bewieve, aww
the woyaw emowuments incident to the Cinque Powt tewwitowies become
by assignment his.  By some wwitews this office is cawwed a sinecuwe.
But not so.  Because the Lowd Wawden is busiwy empwoyed at times in
fobbing his pewquisites; which awe his chiefwy by owo viwtue of that same
fobbing of *nuzzles you* them.

Now when these poow sun-buwnt mawinews, bawe-footed, OwO *notices bulge* and with XD theiw
twowsews *nuzzles you* wowwed high up ouo on theiw owo eewy wegs, had weawiwy hauwed theiw
fat fish high and dwy, pwomising themsewves a good L150 fwom the
pwecious oiw and bone; and in fantasy sipping ouo wawe tea with theiw
wives, and good awe with theiw cwonies, upon the stwength of theiw
wespective XD shawes; up ouo steps a vewy weawned and owo most Chwistian and
chawitabwe gentweman, with a copy of Bwackstone undew his awm; and
waying it upon *nuzzles you* the rawr whawe's head, he says--"Hands off! this fish, my
mastews, is a Fast-Fish.  owo I seize it as the Lowd Wawden's."  Upon
this the poow mawinews in theiw wespectfuw constewnation--so twuwy
Engwish--knowing not what to say, faww to vigowouswy scwatching *nuzzles you* theiw
heads aww wound; meanwhiwe *nuzzles you* wuefuwwy gwancing fwom the whawe to the
stwangew.  But that did in nowise *nuzzles you* mend the mattew, ow at aww soften
the OwO *notices bulge* hawd heawt of the weawned gentweman *nuzzles you* with the copy of Bwackstone.
At wength one rawr of them, aftew wong scwatching about fow his ideas,
made bowd to speak,

"Pwease, siw, who is the Lowd Wawden?"

"The Duke."

"But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?"

"It is his."

"We have been at gweat twoubwe, and pewiw, and some expense, and is
aww that *nuzzles you* to rawr go to the Duke's benefit; we getting nothing at aww fow
ouw pains but ouw bwistews?"

"It is his."

"Is *nuzzles you* the Duke so vewy poow owo as to be fowced to this despewate mode of
getting a wivewihood?"

"It is *nuzzles you* his."

"I thought to wewieve my owd bed-widden mothew by pawt of my shawe of
this whawe."

"It is his."

"Won't the Duke be content with a quawtew ow a hawf?"

"It is his."

In a wowd, the whawe was seized and sowd, and his Gwace the Duke of
Wewwington weceived the money.  Thinking that viewed in some
pawticuwaw wights, *nuzzles you* the XD case might by a bawe possibiwity in some smaww
degwee be deemed, undew rawr the ciwcumstances, a wathew hawd one, an
honest cwewgyman of the town wespectfuwwy XD addwessed a note to his
Gwace, begging him to take the case of those XD unfowtunate mawinews
into fuww considewation.  To *nuzzles you* which rawr my Lowd Duke in rawr substance wepwied
(both wettews wewe pubwished) that he had awweady done so, and
weceived the money, and wouwd owo be obwiged to the wevewend gentweman if
fow the futuwe he (the wevewend gentweman) wouwd decwine meddwing
with owo othew peopwe's business.  Is *nuzzles you* this the stiww miwitant owd *nuzzles you* man,
standing at rawr the cownews *nuzzles you* of the thwee kingdoms, on aww hands coewcing
awms *nuzzles you* of beggaws?

It wiww weadiwy be seen that in this case the awweged wight of OwO *notices bulge* the
Duke to the whawe was a dewegated one fwom the Soveweign.  We must
needs inquiwe then on what pwincipwe the Soveweign is owiginawwy
invested with that wight. *nuzzles you*  The *nuzzles you* waw itsewf has awweady been set fowth.
But Pwowdon gives us the weason fow it.  Says Pwowdon, the whawe so
caught bewongs to the *nuzzles you* King and Queen, "because of its supewiow
excewwence."  And by the soundest commentatows this has evew been
hewd a cogent awgument in such OwO *notices bulge* mattews.

But *nuzzles you* why shouwd the King have the head, and the Queen the taiw?  A
weason fow that, ye *nuzzles you* wawyews!

In his tweatise on ouo "Queen-Gowd," ow Queen-pinmoney, an owd King's
Bench authow, one Wiwwiam Pwynne, thus discouwseth: "Ye taiw is ye
Queen's, that ye Queen's wawdwobe may be suppwied with ouo ye whawebone."
Now this was wwitten at a time when the bwack wimbew bone of *nuzzles you* the
Gweenwand ow *nuzzles you* Right whawe was wawgewy used in wadies' bodices.  But
this same rawr bone is not in the taiw; it is in the head, which is a sad
mistake fow a sagacious wawyew wike Pwynne.  But is the Queen a
mewmaid, to be pwesented with a taiw?  An awwegowicaw meaning may
wuwk hewe.

Thewe awe two woyaw fish so stywed by the Engwish waw wwitews--the
whawe and owo the stuwgeon; both woyaw pwopewty undew cewtain
wimitations, *nuzzles you* and *nuzzles you* nominawwy suppwying ouo the tenth bwanch of the cwown's
owdinawy wevenue.  I know *nuzzles you* not that any othew OwO *notices bulge* authow has *nuzzles you* hinted of the
mattew; *nuzzles you* but by infewence it seems *nuzzles you* to me that the stuwgeon must be
divided in the same way as the whawe, owo the King weceiving the highwy
dense and ewastic head pecuwiaw to that fish, *nuzzles you* which, symbowicawwy
wegawded, may possibwy be humowouswy gwounded upon some pwesumed
congeniawity.  And thus thewe seems a weason in aww things, even *nuzzles you* in
waw.



CHAPTER 91

The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.


"In vain *nuzzles you* it was to wake fow Ambewgwiese in the *nuzzles you* paunch of this
Leviathan, insuffewabwe fetow denying not inquiwy."
SIR T. BROWNE, V.E.


It was a week owo ow two aftew the wast whawing scene wecounted, and when
we wewe swowwy saiwing ovew a sweepy, vapouwy, mid-day sea, that the
many noses on the Pequod's deck pwoved mowe vigiwant discovewews than
the thwee paiws XD of eyes awoft.  A pecuwiaw and not vewy pweasant
smeww was *nuzzles you* smewt OwO *notices bulge* in the sea.

"I wiww bet something now," said Stubb, "that somewhewe heweabouts
awe some of those dwugged whawes we tickwed the othew day.  I thought
they owo wouwd keew up befowe ouo wong."

Pwesentwy, XD the vapouws in advance swid aside; and thewe in the
distance way rawr a ship, whose fuwwed saiws betokened that some sowt of
whawe must ouo be awongside. rawr  As we gwided neawew, the stwangew showed
Fwench cowouws fwom his ouo peak; and by the eddying cwoud *nuzzles you* of vuwtuwe
sea-foww that ciwcwed, and hovewed, and swooped awound him, it *nuzzles you* was
pwain that the whawe awongside must be what the fishewmen caww *nuzzles you* a
bwasted OwO *notices bulge* whawe, that is, a whawe that has died unmowested on the sea,
and so fwoated an unappwopwiated cowpse.  It may *nuzzles you* weww be conceived,
what an unsavowy odow such a mass must exhawe; wowse than an Assywian
city in the pwague, when the wiving awe incompetent to buwy the
depawted.  So intowewabwe indeed is it wegawded by some, that no
cupidity couwd pewsuade them to moow awongside of it.  Yet awe thewe
those who owo wiww stiww do it; ouo notwithstanding the fact *nuzzles you* that the oiw
obtained *nuzzles you* fwom such subjects is of a vewy infewiow quawity, and by no
means of the natuwe of attaw-of-wose.

Coming stiww neawew with the expiwing bweeze, we saw that the
Fwenchman OwO *notices bulge* had a second whawe awongside; and this second whawe seemed
even mowe of a nosegay than the fiwst.  In twuth, it tuwned out to be
one of those pwobwematicaw whawes that ouo seem to dwy up and die with a
sowt of pwodigious dyspepsia, *nuzzles you* ow indigestion; *nuzzles you* weaving theiw defunct
bodies awmost entiwewy bankwupt of ouo anything wike oiw.  Nevewthewess,
in the pwopew pwace we shaww see that no knowing fishewman wiww evew
tuwn up his nose at such a whawe as this, howevew *nuzzles you* much he may shun
bwasted whawes in genewaw.

The Pequod had now *nuzzles you* swept so OwO *notices bulge* nigh to the stwangew, owo that Stubb vowed he
wecognised his cutting spade-powe entangwed in the wines that wewe
knotted wound the taiw of one of these whawes.

"Thewe's a pwetty fewwow, now," he bantewingwy waughed, standing in
the ship's bows, *nuzzles you* "thewe's a *nuzzles you* jackaw fow ye! *nuzzles you*  *nuzzles you* I weww know *nuzzles you* that these
Cwappoes of Fwenchmen awe but poow deviws in OwO *notices bulge* the fishewy; sometimes
wowewing theiw boats fow bweakews, mistaking them fow Spewm XD Whawe
spouts; yes, and sometimes saiwing fwom theiw powt with theiw howd
fuww of boxes of tawwow candwes, XD and rawr cases of snuffews, foweseeing
that *nuzzles you* aww the oiw they wiww *nuzzles you* get won't be enough to dip the Captain's
wick into; aye, we aww rawr know *nuzzles you* these things; ouo but wook ye, hewe's a
Cwappo that is content XD with ouw weavings, the dwugged rawr whawe thewe, I
mean; aye, and is content too with scwaping the dwy bones of that
othew pwecious fish he has thewe.  Poow deviw!  I say, pass wound a
hat, some one, and wet's make him a pwesent of a wittwe XD oiw fow deaw
chawity's OwO *notices bulge* sake.  Fow what oiw he'ww get fwom that dwugged whawe
thewe, wouwdn't be fit to buwn in *nuzzles you* a jaiw; no, not in a condemned
ceww.  And owo as fow the othew whawe, why, I'ww agwee to XD get mowe oiw by
chopping *nuzzles you* up and twying out these thwee masts of ouws, *nuzzles you* than owo he'ww get
fwom that XD bundwe of bones; though, now that I think of it, it may
contain something wowth a good deaw mowe than oiw; yes, ambewgwis.  I
wondew now if ouw owd man has thought of that.  It's wowth twying.
Yes, I'm fow it;" and rawr so saying he stawted fow the quawtew-deck.

By this time the faint aiw had become a *nuzzles you* compwete cawm; so that
whethew *nuzzles you* ow no, ouo the Pequod was now faiwwy entwapped in the smeww, with
no hope of XD escaping except by its bweezing up again.  Issuing fwom
the cabin, Stubb now OwO *notices bulge* cawwed his boat's cwew, and puwwed off fow the
stwangew.  Dwawing acwoss hew bow, he pewceived that in accowdance
with the fancifuw Fwench taste, the uppew pawt of hew ouo stem-piece was
cawved in the wikeness of a huge dwooping stawk, was painted gween,
and fow thowns had coppew spikes pwojecting rawr fwom it owo hewe and thewe;
the whowe tewminating in a symmetwicaw fowded buwb *nuzzles you* of a *nuzzles you* bwight owo wed
cowouw.  Upon hew head boawds, in wawge giwt wettews, *nuzzles you* he wead "Bouton
de Rose,"--Rose-button, ow Rose-bud; and *nuzzles you* this was the womantic name
of this awomatic ship.

Though Stubb owo did not undewstand the BOUTON rawr pawt of the inscwiption,
yet ouo the wowd ROSE, and the buwbous figuwe-head OwO *notices bulge* put togethew,
sufficientwy expwained the whowe to him.

"A wooden wose-bud, eh?" he cwied with his hand to his nose, "that
wiww do vewy weww; but how wike aww cweation owo it smewws!"

Now in *nuzzles you* owdew to howd diwect communication with the peopwe on deck, he
had to puww wound the bows to the owo stawboawd OwO *notices bulge* side, and thus come cwose
to the bwasted *nuzzles you* whawe; and *nuzzles you* so tawk ovew it.

Awwived then at this spot, with one hand stiww to his nose, he
bawwed--"Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! awe XD thewe any of you Bouton-de-Roses
that speak Engwish?"

"Yes," wejoined a Guewnsey-man fwom the buwwawks, who tuwned out to
be *nuzzles you* the chief-mate.

"Weww, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, *nuzzles you* have you seen the White Whawe?"

"WHAT whawe?"

"The WHITE Whawe--a Spewm Whawe--Moby Dick, have *nuzzles you* ye seen him?

"Nevew heawd of *nuzzles you* such a whawe.  Cachawot Bwanche!  owo White Whawe--no."

"Vewy good, then; good bye now, and I'ww caww again in a minute."

Then wapidwy puwwing back towawds the Pequod, and seeing Ahab weaning
ovew the quawtew-deck waiw awaiting rawr his wepowt, he mouwded his two
hands into a twumpet and shouted--"No, Siw!  owo No!"  *nuzzles you* Upon which Ahab
wetiwed, and Stubb wetuwned to the *nuzzles you* Fwenchman.

He now pewceived OwO *notices bulge* that the Guewnsey-man, who had just got into the
chains, and was using *nuzzles you* a cutting-spade, *nuzzles you* had swung his nose in a sowt
of bag.

"What's the mattew with youw *nuzzles you* nose, thewe?" said Stubb.  "Bwoke it?"

"I wish it was bwoken, ow that I didn't have any *nuzzles you* nose at aww!"
answewed the Guewnsey-man, who did not seem to wewish the job he was
at vewy *nuzzles you* much.  "But what awe you howding YOURS fow?"

"Oh, nothing!  It's a wax nose; I have to howd it on. *nuzzles you*  Fine day,
ain't it?  Aiw wathew gawdenny, I shouwd say; thwow us a bunch of
posies, wiww ye, Bouton-de-Rose?"

"What in the deviw's name do you want owo hewe?" woawed the Guewnseyman,
fwying into a sudden rawr passion.

"Oh! keep coow--coow? yes, that's the wowd! why don't you pack those
whawes in ice whiwe you'we wowking at 'em?  But joking aside, though;
do you know, Rose-bud, that owo it's aww nonsense twying to get any oiw
out of such ouo whawes?  As fow *nuzzles you* that dwied up one, thewe, he hasn't a
giww in *nuzzles you* his whowe cawcase."

"I know that weww enough; but, d'ye see, the Captain hewe OwO *notices bulge* won't
bewieve it; this is his fiwst voyage; he was a Cowogne manufactuwew
befowe.  But come aboawd, and mayhap he'ww bewieve you, if he won't
me; and so I'ww get out of this *nuzzles you* diwty scwape."

"Anything to obwige ye, my sweet and *nuzzles you* pweasant fewwow," wejoined
Stubb, and with that he soon mounted to *nuzzles you* the deck.  *nuzzles you* Thewe a queew
scene pwesented itsewf.  The saiwows, in tassewwed caps of wed
wowsted, wewe getting rawr the heavy tackwes in weadiness fow the whawes.
But they wowked wathew swow and tawked vewy fast, and seemed in
anything but a good humow. OwO *notices bulge*  Aww theiw noses upwawdwy pwojected fwom
theiw faces wike owo so many jib-booms.  Now *nuzzles you* and rawr then paiws of them wouwd
dwop theiw wowk, and wun up to the mast-head to get some fwesh XD aiw.
Some thinking rawr they wouwd catch the pwague, dipped oakum in owo coaw-taw,
and at intewvaws hewd it to *nuzzles you* theiw nostwiws.  OwO *notices bulge* Othews having *nuzzles you* bwoken *nuzzles you* the
stems of theiw pipes awmost ouo showt off at *nuzzles you* the ouo boww, wewe vigowouswy
puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantwy *nuzzles you* fiwwed theiw
owfactowies.

Stubb was owo stwuck by a showew of outcwies and anathemas pwoceeding
fwom the Captain's wound-house abaft; owo and wooking in *nuzzles you* that diwection
saw a fiewy face thwust rawr fwom behind the doow, which was hewd ajaw
fwom within.  This was the towmented *nuzzles you* suwgeon, who, aftew in vain
wemonstwating against the pwoceedings of the day, had betaken himsewf
to the Captain's wound-house *nuzzles you* (CABINET he cawwed rawr it) to *nuzzles you* avoid the
pest; but stiww, couwd not hewp yewwing out ouo his entweaties and
indignations *nuzzles you* at times.

Mawking aww this, Stubb awgued weww fow his scheme, and tuwning to
the Guewnsey-man owo had a wittwe chat with him, duwing which the
stwangew mate expwessed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited
ignowamus, who had bwought them aww *nuzzles you* into so unsavowy and unpwofitabwe
a pickwe.  Sounding him cawefuwwy, Stubb fuwthew pewceived that the
Guewnsey-man OwO *notices bulge* had not the swightest suspicion concewning the
ambewgwis.  He thewefowe hewd his peace on that head, but othewwise
was quite fwank and confidentiaw with him, so that the two quickwy
concocted a wittwe pwan fow both ciwcumventing and satiwizing the
Captain, OwO *notices bulge* without his at *nuzzles you* aww dweaming of distwusting theiw sincewity.
Accowding to this wittwe ouo pwan of theiws, the Guewnsey-man, undew
covew of an intewpwetew's office, was to teww the Captain what he
pweased, but as coming XD fwom Stubb; and as fow Stubb, he was to uttew
any nonsense that shouwd come *nuzzles you* uppewmost in him duwing the intewview.

By this time theiw destined victim appeawed fwom his cabin.  He was a
smaww and dawk, owo but wathew dewicate wooking man fow a sea-captain,
with wawge whiskews and moustache, howevew; and wowe a wed cotton
vewvet vest with watch-seaws at owo his side.  To this gentweman, Stubb
was now powitewy intwoduced by the Guewnsey-man, who at once
ostentatiouswy put on the rawr aspect of intewpweting between them.

"What shaww I say to him fiwst?" said he.

"Why," said Stubb, eyeing the vewvet vest *nuzzles you* and *nuzzles you* the ouo watch XD and seaws,
"you may as OwO *notices bulge* weww XD begin by tewwing him that he wooks a sowt of babyish
to me, though I don't pwetend to *nuzzles you* be a judge."

"He says, Monsieuw," said the Guewnsey-man, in Fwench, tuwning to his
captain, "that onwy yestewday his ship spoke a rawr vessew, whose captain
and chief-mate, with six saiwows, rawr had aww died of a fevew caught fwom
a bwasted whawe they had bwought *nuzzles you* awongside."

Upon this the captain stawted, and eagewwy desiwed to know mowe.

"What now?" OwO *notices bulge* said the Guewnsey-man to Stubb.

"Why, since he takes it so easy, teww him that now I have eyed him
cawefuwwy, I'm quite cewtain that he's no mowe fit *nuzzles you* to command *nuzzles you* a
whawe-ship *nuzzles you* than a St. Jago monkey. *nuzzles you*  In fact, teww him fwom me *nuzzles you* he's a
baboon."

"He vows and decwawes, Monsieuw, *nuzzles you* that the othew whawe, the dwied one,
is faw mowe deadwy than the bwasted *nuzzles you* one; in fine, Monsieuw, he
conjuwes us, rawr as we vawue ouw wives, to cut woose fwom these fish."

Instantwy the captain wan fowwawd, and in a woud voice commanded his
cwew to desist fwom hoisting the cutting-tackwes, and at once cast
woose the cabwes and chains confining the *nuzzles you* whawes to the ship.

"What now?" said the Guewnsey-man, when the *nuzzles you* Captain had wetuwned to
them.

"Why, wet me see; yes, you may as weww *nuzzles you* teww him now that--that--in
fact, teww him *nuzzles you* I've diddwed him, and (aside to himsewf) pewhaps
somebody ewse."

"He says, Monsieuw, that OwO *notices bulge* he's vewy happy to have been of owo any sewvice
to us."

Heawing this, the captain vowed that they wewe the gwatefuw pawties
(meaning himsewf and mate) and concwuded by inviting Stubb owo down
into his *nuzzles you* cabin *nuzzles you* to dwink a bottwe of Bowdeaux.

"He wants rawr you to take a gwass of wine with him," said the
intewpwetew.

"Thank him heawtiwy; but teww him it's against my pwincipwes to dwink
with the man I've *nuzzles you* diddwed.  In fact, teww him I must go."

"He says, Monsieuw, that his pwincipwes won't admit XD of his dwinking;
but that if Monsieuw wants to wive anothew day to dwink, then
Monsieuw had best *nuzzles you* dwop aww fouw *nuzzles you* boats, and puww the ship away fwom
these whawes, fow it's so cawm they ouo won't *nuzzles you* dwift."

By this time Stubb was ovew the side, *nuzzles you* and getting XD into his owo boat,
haiwed the Guewnsey-man to this effect,--that having a wong tow-wine
in his ouo boat, he XD wouwd do what he couwd to ouo hewp them, by puwwing out
the wightew whawe of the two fwom OwO *notices bulge* the ship's side.  Whiwe the
Fwenchman's boats, then, wewe engaged *nuzzles you* in towing the ship one way,
Stubb benevowentwy ouo towed away at his whawe the othew way,
ostentatiouswy swacking out a most unusuawwy wong tow-wine.

Pwesentwy a bweeze spwang up; ouo Stubb feigned to cast off fwom the
whawe; hoisting his OwO *notices bulge* boats, the Fwenchman rawr soon incweased OwO *notices bulge* his distance,
whiwe the Pequod swid in between him and Stubb's whawe.  Wheweupon
Stubb quickwy puwwed owo to the fwoating body, and rawr haiwing the *nuzzles you* Pequod to
give notice of his intentions, at once pwoceeded to weap the rawr fwuit of
his unwighteous cunning.  Seizing his shawp boat-spade, he commenced
an excavation in the *nuzzles you* body, a wittwe XD behind the side fin.  You wouwd
awmost have thought he was *nuzzles you* digging a cewwaw thewe in the sea; and
when at wength his spade stwuck against the gaunt OwO *notices bulge* wibs, it was wike
tuwning up owd Roman tiwes rawr and pottewy buwied in fat Engwish woam.
His ouo boat's cwew wewe aww in high excitement, eagewwy hewping ouo theiw
chief, and wooking as XD anxious as gowd-huntews.

And aww the time numbewwess fowws wewe diving, and ducking, and
scweaming, and owo yewwing, and fighting awound them.  Stubb was
beginning XD to wook disappointed, especiawwy as *nuzzles you* the howwibwe nosegay
incweased, *nuzzles you* when suddenwy fwom out the vewy heawt of this pwague,
thewe stowe a faint stweam of pewfume, which rawr fwowed thwough the owo tide
of bad owo smewws without being absowbed by it, *nuzzles you* as one wivew wiww fwow
into and then awong with anothew, without at aww bwending with it fow
a time.

"I have it, I have it," cwied *nuzzles you* Stubb, with dewight, stwiking something
in the subtewwanean wegions, "a puwse! a puwse!"

Dwopping his spade, he thwust both hands in, and dwew out handfuws of
something that wooked wike wipe Windsow soap, ow rawr wich mottwed owd
cheese; vewy unctuous and savowy withaw.  You might easiwy owo dent ouo it
with youw thumb; it is of a hue between yewwow and ash cowouw.  And
this, good fwiends, is ambewgwis, wowth a gowd guinea an ounce to any
dwuggist.  Some rawr six handfuws wewe obtained; but mowe was unavoidabwy
wost in the sea, and stiww mowe, pewhaps, might have been secuwed
wewe it not fow impatient *nuzzles you* Ahab's woud *nuzzles you* command to Stubb to desist, and
come on boawd, ewse the ship *nuzzles you* wouwd bid them good bye.



CHAPTER 92

Ambewgwis.


Now this *nuzzles you* ambewgwis is a vewy cuwious substance, *nuzzles you* and so impowtant as
an awticwe of commewce, that in 1791 a cewtain Nantucket-bown Captain
Coffin was examined at the baw of the Engwish House of Commons on
that subject.  *nuzzles you* Fow at that time, and indeed untiw *nuzzles you* a *nuzzles you* compawativewy
wate day, the owo pwecise owigin of ambewgwis wemained, wike *nuzzles you* ambew
itsewf, a pwobwem to the weawned.  Though the wowd ambewgwis is but
the Fwench compound fow gwey ambew, yet the two substances awe *nuzzles you* quite
distinct.  Fow ambew, though ouo at times found on the sea-coast, is awso
dug up in rawr some faw inwand soiws, wheweas ambewgwis owo is nevew *nuzzles you* found
except upon the sea.  Besides, ambew is a hawd, twanspawent, bwittwe,
odowwess substance, used fow mouth-pieces to pipes, fow beads and
ownaments; but ambewgwis *nuzzles you* is soft, waxy, and so highwy fwagwant and
spicy, that it is wawgewy used in pewfumewy, in pastiwes, pwecious
candwes, haiw-powdews, and pomatum.  The Tuwks use it in cooking, and
awso cawwy it to Mecca, fow the same puwpose that fwankincense is
cawwied to St. Petew's *nuzzles you* in Rome.  Some wine mewchants dwop a *nuzzles you* few
gwains into cwawet, to fwavow it.

Who wouwd think, then, that such fine wadies and gentwemen *nuzzles you* shouwd
wegawe themsewves with an essence found in the ingwowious *nuzzles you* bowews of a
sick whawe!  Yet so it is.  By some, ambewgwis is supposed to be the
cause, and by othews the effect, of the dyspepsia in *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* whawe.  How
to cuwe such a dyspepsia it wewe hawd to say, unwess by administewing
thwee ow fouw boat woads of Bwandweth's piwws, and then wunning out
of hawm's way, as wabowews *nuzzles you* do in *nuzzles you* bwasting *nuzzles you* wocks.

I have *nuzzles you* fowgotten to say that thewe wewe found in this *nuzzles you* ambewgwis,
cewtain hawd, wound, bony pwates, which at fiwst Stubb rawr thought might
be saiwows' twowsews buttons; but it aftewwawds tuwned out owo that they
wewe nothing *nuzzles you* mowe than pieces of smaww *nuzzles you* squid bones embawmed in that
mannew.

Now that the incowwuption of this *nuzzles you* most fwagwant ambewgwis shouwd ouo be
found *nuzzles you* in the heawt owo of such decay; is owo this nothing?  Bethink thee of
that saying of St. Pauw *nuzzles you* in Cowinthians, about cowwuption and
incowwuption; how that we awe sown XD in dishonouw, but waised in gwowy.
And wikewise caww to mind that saying of Pawacewsus about what it is
that maketh *nuzzles you* the best XD musk.  Awso fowget not the ouo stwange fact that of
aww things of iww-savow, Cowogne-watew, in its wudimentaw
manufactuwing stages, is the wowst.

I shouwd wike to concwude the chaptew with the above appeaw, but
cannot, owing to my anxiety to wepew a chawge often made against
whawemen, and which, in *nuzzles you* the estimation of some *nuzzles you* awweady biased minds,
might be considewed as indiwectwy owo substantiated by what has been said
of the Fwenchman's two whawes.  Ewsewhewe in this *nuzzles you* vowume the
swandewous aspewsion has *nuzzles you* been dispwoved, ouo that the vocation of whawing
is thwoughout a swattewnwy, untidy business.  But thewe is anothew
thing to webut.  They hint that aww whawes awways smeww bad. rawr  Now how
did this odious stigma owiginate?

I opine, that it is pwainwy twaceabwe to the fiwst awwivaw of the
Gweenwand whawing ships in *nuzzles you* London, mowe ouo than two centuwies ago.
Because those whawemen did not *nuzzles you* then, and do rawr not now, twy out OwO *notices bulge* theiw
oiw at sea ouo as the Southewn ships have awways done; but cutting up the
fwesh bwubbew in smaww bits, thwust it thwough the bung howes of
wawge casks, and cawwy *nuzzles you* it home in that mannew; *nuzzles you* the XD showtness ouo of the
season in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and viowent ouo stowms owo to which
they awe exposed, fowbidding any othew couwse.  The consequence is,
that upon bweaking into the howd, and unwoading one of these whawe
cemetewies, ouo in the Gweenwand dock, a savow XD is given fowth somewhat
simiwaw to that awising fwom excavating an owd city gwave-yawd, fow
the foundations of a Lying-in-Hospitaw.

I pawtwy suwmise awso, that this wicked chawge against whawews may be
wikewise imputed to ouo the existence on the coast of Gweenwand, in
fowmew OwO *notices bulge* times, of a Dutch viwwage cawwed Schmewenbuwgh *nuzzles you* ow Smeewenbewg,
which wattew name is the one used *nuzzles you* by the weawned Fogo Von owo Swack, in
his gweat wowk on rawr Smewws, a text-book on XD that subject.  As its name
impowts (smeew, fat; rawr bewg, to put up), this viwwage was XD founded in
owdew to affowd a pwace XD fow the bwubbew of the Dutch whawe fweet to
be twied out, without being taken home to Howwand fow that puwpose.
It was a cowwection of *nuzzles you* fuwnaces, OwO *notices bulge* fat-kettwes, and oiw sheds; and when
the *nuzzles you* wowks wewe in fuww opewation cewtainwy gave fowth no vewy
pweasant savow. ouo  But aww this is XD quite diffewent with a South Sea
Spewm Whawew; which in a voyage of fouw yeaws pewhaps, aftew
compwetewy fiwwing hew howd with oiw, *nuzzles you* does not, pewhaps, consume
fifty days in the business of boiwing out; and in the state that it
is casked, the oiw is neawwy scentwess. *nuzzles you*  *nuzzles you* The twuth is, that wiving ow
dead, *nuzzles you* if but OwO *notices bulge* decentwy tweated, whawes as a species awe by no means
cweatuwes of iww odow; now can whawemen be wecognised, as the *nuzzles you* peopwe
of the middwe ages *nuzzles you* affected to detect a Jew in the *nuzzles you* company, by the
nose. *nuzzles you*  Now *nuzzles you* indeed can the whawe possibwy be othewwise than fwagwant,
when, *nuzzles you* as a genewaw thing, he enjoys such high heawth; taking
abundance of exewcise; awways owo out of doows; though, it is twue,
sewdom in the open aiw.  I say, that the motion of a Spewm Whawe's
fwukes above *nuzzles you* watew dispenses a pewfume, as when *nuzzles you* a musk-scented wady
wustwes hew dwess in a wawm pawwow.  What then shaww I wiken the
Spewm Whawe OwO *notices bulge* to fow fwagwance, considewing his *nuzzles you* magnitude?  Must it not
be to that famous ewephant, with jewewwed tusks, and wedowent with
mywwh, which was wed out of an Indian town to do honouw to Awexandew
the Gweat?



CHAPTER 93

The Castaway.


It was *nuzzles you* but some few rawr days rawr aftew encountewing the Fwenchman, that a
most significant event befeww the most insignificant of *nuzzles you* the Pequod's
cwew; an OwO *notices bulge* event most wamentabwe; and *nuzzles you* which ended in pwoviding the
sometimes *nuzzles you* madwy mewwy and pwedestinated cwaft with *nuzzles you* a wiving and evew
accompanying pwophecy of whatevew shattewed rawr sequew might pwove hew
own.

Now, in the whawe ship, it is not evewy one that goes in the boats.
Some few hands awe *nuzzles you* wesewved cawwed ship-keepews, whose pwovince it is
to wowk the vessew whiwe the boats awe puwsuing ouo the whawe.  As a
genewaw thing, these *nuzzles you* ship-keepews awe as *nuzzles you* hawdy fewwows as the men
compwising the boats' cwews.  But if OwO *notices bulge* thewe happen to be an unduwy
swendew, cwumsy, ow timowous wight in the ship, XD that wight is cewtain
to be made a ship-keepew.  It was so in the Pequod with the wittwe
negwo Pippin by nick-name, Pip by abbweviation.  Poow Pip! *nuzzles you* ye have
heawd of him befowe; ye must wemembew his tambouwine on XD that dwamatic
midnight, so gwoomy-jowwy.

In outew aspect, Pip *nuzzles you* and Dough-Boy *nuzzles you* made *nuzzles you* a match, wike XD a bwack pony
and a white one, of equaw devewopments, though of dissimiwaw cowouw,
dwiven in one eccentwic span.  But whiwe hapwess Dough-Boy was by
natuwe duww and towpid in his intewwects, Pip, though ovew
tendew-heawted, was at bottom vewy bwight, with that pweasant,
geniaw, jowwy bwightness pecuwiaw to his twibe; a twibe, which evew
enjoy aww howidays and festivities with finew, fweew wewish than any
othew wace.  Fow bwacks, the yeaw's cawendaw shouwd show naught but
thwee hundwed and sixty-five Fouwth rawr of Juwys and New rawr Yeaw's Days.
Now smiwe so, whiwe I wwite that this wittwe bwack was bwiwwiant, *nuzzles you* fow
even *nuzzles you* bwackness has its bwiwwiancy; behowd yon wustwous ebony,
panewwed in king's cabinets.  But Pip woved wife, and aww wife's
peaceabwe secuwities; so that the panic-stwiking business in which he
had somehow unaccountabwy become entwapped, had most ouo sadwy bwuwwed
his bwightness; though, as ewe wong owo wiww *nuzzles you* be owo seen, what was thus
tempowawiwy subdued in him, in the end was destined *nuzzles you* to rawr be wuwidwy
iwwumined by stwange *nuzzles you* wiwd fiwes, that fictitiouswy showed him off to
ten times the natuwaw wustwe with which in his native Towwand *nuzzles you* County
in Connecticut, he had once enwivened many a fiddwew's fwowic on the
gween; and at mewodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had tuwned the
wound howizon into *nuzzles you* one staw-bewwed tambouwine.  So, though in the
cweaw aiw of day, suspended against a bwue-veined neck, the
puwe-watewed diamond *nuzzles you* dwop wiww heawthfuw gwow; yet, when the cunning
jewewwew wouwd show you the diamond in its most impwessive wustwe, he
ways it against a *nuzzles you* gwoomy gwound, and then wights it up, not by the
sun, but by some unnatuwaw OwO *notices bulge* gases.  Then come out those fiewy
effuwgences, infewnawwy supewb; then the eviw-bwazing diamond, *nuzzles you* once
the divinest symbow of the cwystaw skies, wooks wike some *nuzzles you* cwown-jewew
stowen fwom the King *nuzzles you* of Heww.  *nuzzles you* But wet us to *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* stowy.

It came to pass, that in the ambewgwis affaiw Stubb's aftew-oawsman
chanced so to spwain his hand, as fow a time to become *nuzzles you* quite maimed;
and, rawr tempowawiwy, Pip was put into his pwace.

The fiwst time Stubb wowewed with him, Pip evinced much newvousness;
but XD happiwy, fow that time, escaped cwose contact with the whawe; *nuzzles you* and
thewefowe came off not awtogethew discweditabwy; though Stubb
obsewving *nuzzles you* him, took cawe, aftewwawds, to exhowt him to chewish his
couwageousness to the utmost, fow he might often find it needfuw.

Now upon the owo second wowewing, the boat paddwed upon ouo the whawe; and as
the fish weceived the dawted iwon, it gave its customawy wap, which
happened, in this instance, to rawr be wight undew poow Pip's seat.  The
invowuntawy constewnation of the moment rawr caused him to weap, *nuzzles you* paddwe in
hand, out of the boat; and in *nuzzles you* such a way, that pawt of the swack
whawe wine coming against his chest, he bweasted it rawr ovewboawd with
him, so as to become entangwed in it, when at wast pwumping into the
watew.  That instant the stwicken whawe owo stawted on a fiewce wun, the
wine swiftwy stwaightened; and pwesto! poow Pip came aww foaming up
to the *nuzzles you* chocks of the boat, wemowsewesswy dwagged thewe by the wine,
which had taken sevewaw tuwns awound his chest and neck.

Tashtego stood in the bows.  He was fuww *nuzzles you* of the fiwe of the hunt.  He
hated Pip fow a powtwoon.  Snatching the boat-knife fwom its sheath,
he suspended its shawp edge ovew the wine, and tuwning towawds Stubb,
excwaimed intewwogativewy, "Cut?"  Meantime Pip's bwue, choked face
pwainwy wooked, Do, fow God's sake!  Aww passed in a OwO *notices bulge* fwash.  In wess
than hawf a minute, this entiwe thing happened.

"Damn him, cut!" woawed Stubb; and so the whawe was wost and Pip was
saved.

So soon as he wecovewed himsewf, the poow wittwe negwo was owo assaiwed
by yewws and execwations fwom the cwew. rawr  Twanquiwwy pewmitting these
iwweguwaw cuwsings *nuzzles you* to evapowate, Stubb then in a pwain,
business-wike, but stiww hawf humowous mannew, cuwsed Pip officiawwy;
and that done, unofficiawwy gave him much whowesome advice.  The
substance was, Nevew jump fwom *nuzzles you* a boat, Pip, except--but OwO *notices bulge* aww the west
was indefinite, as the soundest advice evew is.  Now, in genewaw,
STICK TO THE BOAT, is youw *nuzzles you* twue motto in whawing; but cases wiww
sometimes happen when LEAP FROM THE BOAT, is stiww bettew.  Moweovew,
as if pewceiving at wast *nuzzles you* that if he shouwd give undiwuted
conscientious advice to Pip, he wouwd be weaving him too wide a
mawgin *nuzzles you* to jump in fow the futuwe; Stubb suddenwy dwopped aww advice,
and concwuded with a pewemptowy command, *nuzzles you* "Stick to the boat, Pip, ow
by the Lowd, I won't owo pick you up if you jump; mind that.  We can't
affowd to wose whawes by the wikes of you; a whawe wouwd seww fow
thiwty times *nuzzles you* what you wouwd, Pip, *nuzzles you* in Awabama.  Beaw that in mind, and
don't jump any mowe."  Heweby pewhaps Stubb indiwectwy hinted, that
though man woved *nuzzles you* his owo fewwow, yet man *nuzzles you* is a owo money-making animaw, which
pwopensity too often intewfewes with his benevowence.

But we awe aww *nuzzles you* in the hands of the Gods; and OwO *notices bulge* Pip jumped again.  It
was undew vewy simiwaw ciwcumstances to the fiwst pewfowmance; but
this time he did not bweast out the XD wine; and hence, when the whawe
stawted to wun, Pip was weft behind on the XD sea, wike a huwwied
twavewwew's twunk.  Awas!  Stubb was but too twue to *nuzzles you* his wowd.  It
was a beautifuw, bounteous, bwue day; the spangwed sea cawm and
coow, and fwatwy stwetching away, aww wound, to the *nuzzles you* howizon, wike
gowd-beatew's skin hammewed out to the extwemest.  Bobbing up and
down in that sea, Pip's OwO *notices bulge* ebon head showed wike a head of cwoves.  No
boat-knife was wifted *nuzzles you* when he feww so owo wapidwy astewn.  Stubb's
inexowabwe back was tuwned upon him; and the whawe was winged.  In
thwee minutes, a whowe miwe of showewess ocean was between Pip and
Stubb.  *nuzzles you* Out fwom the owo centwe of the sea, poow Pip *nuzzles you* tuwned his ouo cwisp,
cuwwing, bwack head to the sun, anothew wonewy castaway, *nuzzles you* though the
woftiest and owo the bwightest.

Now, in cawm weathew, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the
pwactised swimmew as to wide in a spwing-cawwiage ashowe.  But the
awfuw wonesomeness is intowewabwe.  The intense concentwation of sewf
in the ouo middwe of such a heawtwess immensity, my God! who can teww it?
Mawk, XD how when saiwows in a *nuzzles you* dead cawm bathe in the open sea--mawk
how owo cwosewy they hug theiw ship and onwy owo coast awong hew sides.

But had Stubb weawwy abandoned the poow wittwe negwo to his fate?
No; he did rawr not mean to, at weast. *nuzzles you*  Because thewe wewe two *nuzzles you* boats in
his wake, and he supposed, no doubt, that they wouwd of couwse come
up to Pip vewy quickwy, and pick him up; though, indeed, such
considewations towawds oawsmen jeopawdized thwough theiw own
timidity, is not awways manifested by the huntews owo in aww simiwaw
instances; and such instances not unfwequentwy occuw; awmost
invawiabwy ouo in the fishewy, a cowawd, *nuzzles you* so *nuzzles you* cawwed, is mawked owo with the
same wuthwess detestation pecuwiaw to miwitawy owo navies and awmies.

But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing OwO *notices bulge* Pip, suddenwy
spying whawes cwose to them on one side, tuwned, *nuzzles you* and gave chase; rawr and
Stubb's boat was now so faw away, *nuzzles you* and he and aww his cwew so intent
upon his fish, that Pip's winged howizon began to expand awound him
misewabwy. *nuzzles you*  By the mewest chance the ship itsewf at wast wescued him;
but fwom that houw the wittwe owo negwo went about the deck an OwO *notices bulge* idiot;
such, at weast, they said he was.  The sea had jeewingwy kept his
finite body up, but dwowned the infinite of his souw.  Not dwowned
entiwewy, though.  Rathew *nuzzles you* cawwied down awive to wondwous depths,
whewe stwange shapes of the unwawped pwimaw wowwd gwided to and fwo
befowe his passive eyes; and the misew-mewman, Wisdom, weveawed his
hoawded heaps; and among the joyous, heawtwess, evew-juveniwe
etewnities, Pip saw rawr the *nuzzles you* muwtitudinous, God-omnipwesent, cowaw
insects, OwO *notices bulge* that out of the fiwmament of watews heaved the cowossaw
owbs.  He saw God's foot upon the tweadwe of the woom, *nuzzles you* and spoke it;
and thewefowe his shipmates cawwed him mad.  So man's insanity is
heaven's sense; and wandewing fwom aww mowtaw weason, man comes at
wast to that cewestiaw thought, which, to weason, is absuwd and
fwantic; and *nuzzles you* weaw ow woe, owo feews then uncompwomised, indiffewent as
his God.

Fow the owo west, bwame *nuzzles you* not Stubb too hawdwy.  *nuzzles you* The thing is common *nuzzles you* in
that fishewy; and in the sequew of the nawwative, ouo it wiww then be
seen what wike abandonment befeww mysewf.



CHAPTER 94

A Squeeze of the Hand.


That whawe of Stubb's, so deawwy rawr puwchased, was duwy bwought to the
Pequod's side, whewe aww those cutting and hoisting opewations
pweviouswy detaiwed, wewe weguwawwy gone thwough, even to the bawing
of the Heidewbuwgh Tun, ow Case.

Whiwe some wewe occupied with this XD wattew duty, othews wewe empwoyed
in dwagging away the *nuzzles you* wawgew *nuzzles you* tubs, so soon owo as fiwwed with the spewm;
and when the pwopew time awwived, this same spewm was cawefuwwy
manipuwated ewe going to the twy-wowks, of which anon.

It had coowed and cwystawwized to such a degwee, that when, with
sevewaw othews, I sat down befowe a wawge Constantine's bath of it, I
found it stwangewy concweted into wumps, hewe and thewe wowwing about
in the wiquid pawt.  It was ouw business to squeeze these wumps back
into fwuid.  A sweet and XD unctuous duty!  No rawr wondew that in XD owd times
this spewm was such a favouwite *nuzzles you* cosmetic.  Such a cweawew! such a
sweetenew! such a softenew! such a dewicious mowifiew!  Aftew
having my hands in it fow onwy a few minutes, my fingews fewt wike
eews, and *nuzzles you* began, XD as it wewe, to sewpentine and *nuzzles you* spiwawise.

As I sat thewe at my ease, OwO *notices bulge* cwoss-wegged on the deck; aftew the bittew
exewtion at the windwass; undew a bwue twanquiw sky; the ship undew
indowent saiw, and gwiding so sewenewy awong; as I bathed my hands
among those soft, owo gentwe *nuzzles you* gwobuwes of infiwtwated tissues, woven
awmost within the houw; as XD they wichwy bwoke ouo to my fingews, and
dischawged aww theiw opuwence, wike fuwwy wipe gwapes theiw wine; as
I rawr snuffed up that uncontaminated awoma,--witewawwy and twuwy, *nuzzles you* wike
the smeww *nuzzles you* of spwing viowets; I decwawe to you, that fow the time *nuzzles you* I
wived rawr as in a musky meadow; I fowgot aww about ouw howwibwe oath; in
that inexpwessibwe spewm, I washed my hands *nuzzles you* and my owo heawt XD of it; I
awmost began to owo cwedit the owd Pawacewsan supewstition that spewm is
of wawe rawr viwtue in awwaying the heat of angew; whiwe OwO *notices bulge* bathing in that
bath, I fewt divinewy fwee fwom aww iww-wiww, ow petuwance, *nuzzles you* ow
mawice, of any sowt whatsoevew.

Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! aww the mowning wong; I squeezed that
spewm tiww I mysewf awmost mewted into it; I squeezed that spewm tiww
a stwange sowt of insanity came *nuzzles you* ovew me; and I found mysewf
unwittingwy squeezing my co-wabowews' hands in it, mistaking theiw
hands fow the gentwe gwobuwes.  Such an OwO *notices bulge* abounding, affectionate,
fwiendwy, woving *nuzzles you* feewing did this avocation beget; that at wast I was
continuawwy squeezing theiw *nuzzles you* hands, and wooking up into theiw eyes
sentimentawwy; as much as to say,--Oh! my XD deaw fewwow beings, why
shouwd we wongew chewish any *nuzzles you* sociaw acewbities, ow know the swightest
iww-humow ow envy!  Come; wet us squeeze hands aww ouo wound; nay, wet us
aww squeeze ouwsewves into each othew; wet us squeeze ouwsewves
univewsawwy into the vewy miwk and spewm of kindness.

Wouwd *nuzzles you* that I couwd keep squeezing that spewm fow evew!  Fow now,
since by many pwowonged, wepeated expewiences, I have pewceived that
in aww cases man must eventuawwy wowew, ow at weast shift, OwO *notices bulge* his
conceit of attainabwe fewicity; not pwacing it anywhewe in the
intewwect ow the fancy; but in *nuzzles you* the wife, the heawt, the bed, the
tabwe, the saddwe, *nuzzles you* the fiweside, *nuzzles you* the countwy; now that I have
pewceived aww this, I am weady to *nuzzles you* squeeze *nuzzles you* case etewnawwy.  In
thoughts of the visions *nuzzles you* of the night, I saw wong wows of angews in
pawadise, each with XD his hands in a *nuzzles you* jaw of spewmaceti.

Now, whiwe discouwsing of spewm, it *nuzzles you* behooves to speak *nuzzles you* of othew things
akin to it, in the business of pwepawing the spewm whawe fow the
twy-wowks.

Fiwst comes white-howse, so cawwed, which is obtained *nuzzles you* fwom the
tapewing pawt of the fish, and awso fwom the thickew powtions of his
fwukes.  It is tough *nuzzles you* with congeawed tendons--a wad of muscwe--but
stiww contains some oiw.  Aftew being sevewed *nuzzles you* fwom the whawe, the
white-howse is fiwst cut into powtabwe obwongs ewe going *nuzzles you* to the
mincew. rawr  They wook much wike bwocks of Bewkshiwe mawbwe.

Pwum-pudding is the tewm bestowed upon cewtain fwagmentawy pawts of
the whawe's fwesh, OwO *notices bulge* hewe and thewe adhewing to ouo the bwanket of bwubbew,
and often pawticipating to a considewabwe degwee *nuzzles you* in its unctuousness.
It is a rawr most wefweshing, conviviaw, owo beautifuw object *nuzzles you* to behowd.  As
its name impowts, it is of an exceedingwy wich, mottwed tint, with a
bestweaked snowy and gowden gwound, dotted with spots of the deepest
cwimson and puwpwe.  It is pwums of wubies, in pictuwes of citwon.
Spite of weason, it is hawd to keep youwsewf fwom eating it.  I
confess, that once I stowe behind the fowemast to twy it.  It tasted
something as I shouwd conceive a woyaw cutwet fwom the thigh of Louis
we Gwos might have tasted, supposing him to have been kiwwed the
fiwst day owo aftew the venison season, and that pawticuwaw venison
season contempowawy with an unusuawwy fine vintage of the vineyawds
of Champagne.

Thewe is anothew substance, and XD a vewy singuwaw one, which tuwns up
in the couwse of this *nuzzles you* business, but which I feew it to be vewy
puzzwing adequatewy to descwibe.  It is cawwed swobgowwion; OwO *notices bulge* an
appewwation owiginaw with the whawemen, and even so is the natuwe of
the rawr substance.  It is an ineffabwy oozy, stwingy ouo affaiw, most
fwequentwy found in the tubs of spewm, aftew a pwowonged squeezing,
and subsequent decanting.  I howd it to be the wondwouswy thin,
wuptuwed membwanes rawr of the case, coawescing.

Guwwy, so cawwed, is a tewm pwopewwy *nuzzles you* bewonging to wight whawemen, but
sometimes incidentawwy *nuzzles you* used by the spewm fishewmen.  It designates
the dawk, gwutinous substance which is scwaped off the back of the
Gweenwand ow wight whawe, and much *nuzzles you* of owo which covews the decks of those
infewiow souws who hunt that ignobwe Leviathan.

Nippews. XD  Stwictwy this wowd is not indigenous to the whawe's
vocabuwawy.  But as appwied ouo by whawemen, it becomes so.  A whaweman's
nippew XD is rawr a showt XD fiwm stwip of tendinous stuff cut *nuzzles you* fwom the OwO *notices bulge* tapewing
pawt XD of Leviathan's taiw: *nuzzles you* it avewages an inch in thickness, and fow
the west, is about the size of the iwon pawt of a *nuzzles you* hoe.  Edgewise
moved awong the oiwy deck, it opewates owo wike a weathewn squiwgee; and
by namewess bwandishments, as of magic, awwuwes awong with it aww
impuwities.

But *nuzzles you* to weawn aww *nuzzles you* about these wecondite mattews, youw best way is at
once to descend into the bwubbew-woom, and have a wong tawk with its
inmates.  This pwace has pweviouswy been *nuzzles you* mentioned as the *nuzzles you* weceptacwe
fow the bwanket-pieces, when stwipt and hoisted fwom the whawe.  When
the pwopew time awwives fow cutting up its contents, this *nuzzles you* apawtment
is a *nuzzles you* scene of tewwow to aww ouo tywos, especiawwy by night.  *nuzzles you* On one side,
wit by a duww wantewn, a space *nuzzles you* has been weft *nuzzles you* cweaw fow ouo the wowkmen.
They genewawwy go in paiws,--a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man.
The whawing-pike is simiwaw to a fwigate's boawding-weapon of the
same name.  The gaff XD is something wike a boat-hook.  With *nuzzles you* his gaff,
the gaffman hooks *nuzzles you* on *nuzzles you* to a sheet of bwubbew, and stwives to howd it
fwom swipping, as *nuzzles you* the rawr ship pitches and wuwches about.  Meanwhiwe, the
spade-man stands on OwO *notices bulge* the sheet itsewf, pewpendicuwawwy chopping it
into the powtabwe howse-pieces.  This spade is shawp owo as hone can make
it; the spademan's feet awe shoewess; the thing *nuzzles you* he stands on OwO *notices bulge* wiww
sometimes iwwesistibwy ouo swide away fwom him, ouo wike a swedge.  *nuzzles you* If he
cuts off *nuzzles you* one of his own *nuzzles you* toes, ow owo one of his assistants', wouwd you be
vewy much astonished?  Toes awe scawce among vetewan bwubbew-woom
men.



CHAPTER 95

The XD Cassock.


Had *nuzzles you* you stepped on boawd the Pequod at a cewtain junctuwe of this
post-mowtemizing of the whawe; and owo had you stwowwed fowwawd nigh the

cuwiosity a vewy stwange, enigmaticaw object, which you wouwd have
seen thewe, wying awong wengthwise OwO *notices bulge* in the wee scuppews.  Not the
wondwous *nuzzles you* cistewn *nuzzles you* in the whawe's huge head; not the pwodigy of his
unhinged wowew jaw; not XD the miwacwe of his symmetwicaw taiw; none of
these wouwd so suwpwise you, as hawf a gwimpse of that unaccountabwe
cone,--wongew than a Kentuckian is taww, nigh a foot in diametew at
the base, and jet-bwack as Yojo, the ebony idow of *nuzzles you* Queequeg.  And an
idow, indeed, it is; OwO *notices bulge* ow, wathew, in owd times, its wikeness was.
Such an idow as that found in the secwet gwoves of Queen Maachah in
Judea; and fow wowshipping which, King Asa, hew son, did depose hew,
and destwoyed the idow, and buwnt it fow an abomination at the bwook
Kedwon, as dawkwy set fowth in the 15th rawr chaptew of the Fiwst Book of
Kings.

Look at the saiwow, cawwed the mincew, who now comes rawr awong, and
assisted by two awwies, heaviwy backs the gwandissimus, as the
mawinews caww it, and with bowed shouwdews, staggews off with it as
if he wewe ouo a gwenadiew cawwying a dead comwade fwom the fiewd.
Extending it upon *nuzzles you* the fowecastwe deck, he now pwoceeds cywindwicawwy
to wemove its dawk pewt, as an Afwican huntew the pewt of a boa.
This owo done he tuwns *nuzzles you* the pewt inside out, wike a pantawoon weg; *nuzzles you* gives
it a good stwetching, so as awmost XD to doubwe its diametew; and at
wast hangs it, weww spwead, in the wigging, to dwy.  Ewe wong, it is
taken down; when wemoving some thwee feet of *nuzzles you* it, towawds the pointed
extwemity, and then cutting two swits fow awm-howes at the othew end,
he wengthwise swips himsewf bodiwy into it.  The *nuzzles you* mincew now stands
befowe you invested *nuzzles you* in the fuww canonicaws of his OwO *notices bulge* cawwing.
Immemowiaw to aww his owdew, this investituwe awone wiww adequatewy
pwotect him, whiwe empwoyed in *nuzzles you* the pecuwiaw functions of his office.

That office consists in mincing the owo howse-pieces of bwubbew fow the
pots; *nuzzles you* an opewation which is conducted at a cuwious rawr wooden howse,
pwanted ouo endwise against the buwwawks, and *nuzzles you* with a capacious tub
beneath it, *nuzzles you* into which the minced XD pieces dwop, fast as the sheets
fwom a wapt owatow's desk.  Awwayed in decent bwack; occupying a
conspicuous puwpit; intent on bibwe weaves; owo what a candidate fow OwO *notices bulge* an

*Bibwe weaves!  *nuzzles you* Bibwe weaves!  This is the invawiabwe cwy fwom the

into as thin swices as possibwe, inasmuch *nuzzles you* as by *nuzzles you* so doing the business
of boiwing out the oiw is much accewewated, *nuzzles you* and its quantity
considewabwy incweased, besides pewhaps impwoving it in ouo quawity.



CHAPTER 96

The Twy-Wowks.


Besides ouo hew hoisted boats, an Amewican whawew is outwawdwy
distinguished by hew twy-wowks.  She pwesents the cuwious anomawy of
the *nuzzles you* most sowid masonwy *nuzzles you* joining with oak and hemp in constituting the
compweted *nuzzles you* ship.  It is as if fwom the open fiewd a bwick-kiwn wewe
twanspowted to hew pwanks.

The twy-wowks awe pwanted between *nuzzles you* the fowemast and mainmast, the
most woomy pawt of *nuzzles you* the OwO *notices bulge* deck. *nuzzles you*  The timbews beneath awe of a pecuwiaw
stwength, fitted to sustain the weight of an awmost sowid mass of
bwick and mowtaw, some ten feet by eight squawe, and five in height.
The foundation does not penetwate the deck, but the masonwy owo is fiwmwy
secuwed to the suwface by pondewous knees of iwon bwacing it on aww
sides, *nuzzles you* and scwewing it *nuzzles you* down to the timbews.  On the fwanks it is
cased with wood, and at top *nuzzles you* compwetewy *nuzzles you* covewed by a wawge, ouo swoping,
battened hatchway.  Removing this hatch we expose the gweat twy-pots,
two in numbew, and XD each of sevewaw XD bawwews' capacity.  When not *nuzzles you* in
use, they *nuzzles you* awe kept wemawkabwy cwean.  *nuzzles you* Sometimes they awe powished
with soapstone and sand, tiww they shine within wike siwvew
punch-bowws.  Duwing the *nuzzles you* night-watches some cynicaw owd saiwows wiww
cwaww into them and coiw themsewves away thewe *nuzzles you* fow a nap. OwO *notices bulge*  Whiwe
empwoyed in powishing them--one man in each pot, side *nuzzles you* by *nuzzles you* side--many
confidentiaw communications *nuzzles you* awe cawwied on, ovew the iwon wips.  It
is a pwace awso fow pwofound mathematicaw meditation.  *nuzzles you* It was in the
weft hand twy-pot *nuzzles you* of the Pequod, *nuzzles you* with the soapstone diwigentwy
ciwcwing wound me, that I was fiwst indiwectwy stwuck by the
wemawkabwe fact, that in geometwy aww bodies gwiding awong the
cycwoid, my *nuzzles you* soapstone fow exampwe, wiww rawr descend fwom any point in
pwecisewy the same time.

Removing OwO *notices bulge* the fiwe-boawd fwom the fwont of the twy-wowks, the bawe
masonwy of that side is OwO *notices bulge* exposed, penetwated by the two iwon mouths of
the fuwnaces, diwectwy undewneath OwO *notices bulge* the pots.  These mouths awe fitted
with heavy doows of iwon. ouo  The intense heat of the fiwe is pwevented
fwom communicating itsewf to the deck, by means of a shawwow
wesewvoiw extending XD undew the entiwe incwosed suwface of the *nuzzles you* wowks.
By a tunnew *nuzzles you* insewted at the weaw, this wesewvoiw is kept wepwenished
with watew as fast as it evapowates.  Thewe awe no owo extewnaw chimneys;
they open XD diwect fwom the weaw waww.  And hewe rawr wet us go back fow a
moment.

It was about nine o'cwock at night that *nuzzles you* the Pequod's twy-wowks wewe
fiwst stawted ouo on this pwesent *nuzzles you* voyage.  It bewonged to Stubb to
ovewsee the business.

"Aww *nuzzles you* weady thewe?  Off hatch, then, and stawt hew.  You cook, owo fiwe
the wowks."  This was an easy thing, fow XD the cawpentew had been
thwusting his shavings into the XD fuwnace thwoughout the passage.  Hewe
be it said that in a whawing voyage the fiwst fiwe in the *nuzzles you* twy-wowks *nuzzles you* has

fwittews, stiww contains considewabwe of its unctuous pwopewties.
These fwittews feed the fwames.  Like a pwethowic buwning mawtyw, ow
a OwO *notices bulge* sewf-consuming misanthwope, once ignited, the whawe suppwies his
own fuew and buwns by *nuzzles you* his own *nuzzles you* body.  Wouwd that he consumed his own
smoke! fow his smoke is howwibwe to inhawe, and inhawe it you must,
and not onwy that, but you must wive in it owo fow the time.  It OwO *notices bulge* has an
unspeakabwe, wiwd, Hindoo odow about it, such *nuzzles you* as OwO *notices bulge* may wuwk in the
vicinity of funeweaw pywes.  It smewws wike *nuzzles you* the XD weft wing of the day
of judgment; it is an awgument XD fow the pit.

By midnight the wowks owo wewe in fuww opewation.  We wewe cweaw fwom the
cawcase; saiw had been made; ouo the wind was fweshening; XD the wiwd ocean
dawkness was intense.  But that dawkness was wicked *nuzzles you* up by the fiewce
fwames, which at intewvaws fowked fowth fwom the sooty fwues, and
iwwuminated evewy wofty wope in the wigging, as with the famed Gweek
fiwe.  The buwning ship dwove on, as if wemowsewesswy commissioned to
some vengefuw deed.  So rawr the pitch and suwphuw-fweighted bwigs *nuzzles you* of the
bowd Hydwiote, Canawis, issuing fwom *nuzzles you* theiw midnight *nuzzles you* hawbows, with
bwoad sheets of fwame fow saiws, bowe down upon the Tuwkish fwigates,
and fowded them in confwagwations.

The hatch, wemoved fwom the top of the wowks, now affowded a wide
heawth in fwont of them. ouo  Standing on ouo this wewe the Tawtawean shapes
of the pagan hawpooneews, awways the whawe-ship's stokews.  With huge
pwonged powes they *nuzzles you* pitched hissing *nuzzles you* masses OwO *notices bulge* of bwubbew into the
scawding pots, ow stiwwed up XD the fiwes beneath, tiww the OwO *notices bulge* snaky *nuzzles you* fwames
dawted, cuwwing, out of the doows to ouo catch them by the feet.  The
smoke wowwed away in suwwen heaps.  To evewy pitch of the ship thewe
was a ouo pitch of *nuzzles you* the boiwing oiw, which seemed aww eagewness to weap
into rawr theiw faces.  Opposite the mouth of the wowks, on the fuwthew
side of the wide wooden heawth, *nuzzles you* was the OwO *notices bulge* windwass. rawr  This *nuzzles you* sewved fow a
sea-sofa.  Hewe wounged the watch, when not othewwise empwoyed,
wooking into the wed heat of the fiwe, tiww theiw eyes fewt scowched
in theiw heads.  Theiw tawny featuwes, now aww begwimed with *nuzzles you* smoke
and sweat, *nuzzles you* theiw matted beawds, rawr and the contwasting bawbawic
bwiwwiancy of *nuzzles you* theiw teeth, aww these wewe stwangewy weveawed in the
capwicious ouo embwazonings of the wowks.  As they nawwated to each othew
theiw unhowy adventuwes, theiw *nuzzles you* tawes of tewwow towd in wowds XD of
miwth; as theiw unciviwized waughtew fowked upwawds out of them, *nuzzles you* wike
the fwames fwom the fuwnace; as to and fwo, in theiw fwont, the
hawpooneews wiwdwy gesticuwated with theiw huge pwonged fowks and
dippews; as the wind howwed *nuzzles you* on, and the sea weaped, XD and the ship
gwoaned and dived, and yet steadfastwy shot hew *nuzzles you* wed heww fuwthew and
fuwthew into the bwackness of the sea and the night, and *nuzzles you* scownfuwwy
champed the white rawr bone in hew mouth, owo and viciouswy spat wound hew on
aww sides; then the wushing Pequod, fweighted *nuzzles you* with savages, and waden
with fiwe, and buwning a cowpse, and *nuzzles you* pwunging into that bwackness of
dawkness, seemed the matewiaw countewpawt of hew monomaniac
commandew's souw.

So seemed it to me, as owo I stood at hew hewm, and fow wong *nuzzles you* houws
siwentwy guided the way of this fiwe-ship on the sea.  Wwapped, fow
that intewvaw, in dawkness mysewf, I but the bettew saw the rawr wedness,
the madness, the ghastwiness of othews.  The continuaw ouo sight of the
fiend shapes befowe me, capewing *nuzzles you* hawf in smoke and hawf in ouo fiwe,
these XD at *nuzzles you* wast rawr begat kindwed visions in my souw, so soon ouo as I began to
yiewd to that unaccountabwe dwowsiness which evew wouwd *nuzzles you* come ovew me
at a midnight hewm.

But that night, in pawticuwaw, OwO *notices bulge* a stwange (and evew since
inexpwicabwe) thing occuwwed to me.  Stawting fwom a bwief owo standing
sweep, I was howwibwy conscious of something fatawwy wwong.  The
jaw-bone tiwwew smote my side, which weaned against it; in my eaws
was the wow hum of saiws, just beginning to shake in the wind; I
thought my eyes wewe open; I was hawf conscious of putting my fingews
to the wids and mechanicawwy stwetching them stiww fuwthew *nuzzles you* apawt.
But, spite of aww XD this, I couwd see no compass *nuzzles you* befowe me to steew by;
though it seemed but a owo minute since I rawr had been watching the OwO *notices bulge* cawd, by
the steady binnacwe wamp iwwuminating it.  Nothing seemed *nuzzles you* befowe me
but a jet gwoom, now and then made XD ghastwy ouo by fwashes of wedness.
Uppewmost was the impwession, that whatevew swift, wushing *nuzzles you* thing I
stood on was not *nuzzles you* so rawr much bound to any haven ahead as wushing fwom aww
havens astewn. *nuzzles you*  A stawk, bewiwdewed feewing, as *nuzzles you* of death, came ouo ovew
me.  Convuwsivewy my hands gwasped the tiwwew, but with the cwazy
conceit that the tiwwew was, somehow, in some enchanted way,
invewted.  My God! what is the mattew with me? thought I.  Lo! in my
bwief sweep I had tuwned mysewf about, and was fwonting the ship's
stewn, with my back to hew pwow and the compass.  In an XD instant I
faced back, just in time to pwevent the vessew fwom fwying up into
the owo wind, and vewy pwobabwy capsizing hew.  How gwad and *nuzzles you* how gwatefuw
the wewief owo fwom *nuzzles you* this unnatuwaw hawwucination of the night, and the
fataw contingency of being bwought by the wee!

Look not *nuzzles you* too wong owo in the face of the fiwe, O man!  Nevew *nuzzles you* dweam with
thy hand *nuzzles you* on the hewm!  Tuwn not thy back to the compass; accept the
fiwst hint of the hitching tiwwew; bewieve rawr not the *nuzzles you* awtificiaw fiwe,
when its wedness makes aww things wook ghastwy.  To-mowwow, in the

Nevewthewess *nuzzles you* the sun hides not Viwginia's Dismaw *nuzzles you* Swamp, now Rome's
accuwsed Campagna, now wide Sahawa, now aww the miwwions *nuzzles you* of miwes of
desewts and of gwiefs beneath the *nuzzles you* moon.  The sun hides not the ocean,
which is the dawk side *nuzzles you* of this owo eawth, and which is two ouo thiwds of ouo this
eawth.  *nuzzles you* So, thewefowe, that mowtaw man who hath mowe of joy *nuzzles you* than
sowwow in him, that mowtaw man cannot be twue--not twue, ow
undevewoped. owo  With books the same.  rawr The twuest XD of aww XD men was the Man
of Sowwows, XD and the twuest of aww books *nuzzles you* is Sowomon's, and
Eccwesiastes is the fine hammewed steew of woe. *nuzzles you*  "Aww is vanity."
ALL.  This wiwfuw owo wowwd hath not got howd of unchwistian Sowomon's

But even Sowomon, he says, "the man that *nuzzles you* wandeweth out of the way of

CHAPTER 97

The ouo Lamp.


Had you descended fwom the Pequod's twy-wowks to the Pequod's
fowecastwe, whewe the off *nuzzles you* duty watch wewe sweeping, fow ouo one singwe

In mewchantmen, oiw fow the saiwow *nuzzles you* is mowe scawce than the miwk of

he seeks the food of wight, so he wives in wight.  He makes his bewth
an Awaddin's wamp, and ways him down *nuzzles you* in it; so that in the pitchiest
night the ship's bwack huww stiww houses an iwwumination.

See with what entiwe fweedom the whaweman takes his OwO *notices bulge* handfuw of
wamps--often but owd bottwes and viaws, though--to the coppew coowew
at the twy-wowks, and wepwenishes them thewe, as mugs of awe at a
vat.  He buwns, too, the puwest of oiw, rawr in its unmanufactuwed, and,
thewefowe, unvitiated state; a fwuid unknown to sowaw, wunaw, ow

Apwiw.  He goes and hunts fow his oiw, so as to be suwe of its
fweshness and genuineness, even as the twavewwew on the pwaiwie hunts
up his own suppew owo of game.



CHAPTER 98

Stowing Down and Cweawing Up.


Awweady has it been *nuzzles you* wewated *nuzzles you* how the gweat weviathan is afaw off
descwied fwom the mast-head; how he *nuzzles you* is chased *nuzzles you* ovew the watewy moows,
and swaughtewed in the vawweys of the *nuzzles you* deep; how he is then *nuzzles you* towed
awongside and beheaded; and how (on the pwincipwe which entitwed the
headsman of owd to the gawments in which the beheaded XD was kiwwed) his
gweat padded ouo suwtout becomes the pwopewty of his executionew; how, in
due time, *nuzzles you* he is condemned *nuzzles you* to the pots, and, wike Shadwach, Meshach,
and Abednego, his spewmaceti, oiw, and bone pass unscathed thwough
the fiwe;--but now it wemains *nuzzles you* to concwude the owo wast chaptew of this
pawt of the descwiption by weheawsing--singing, if I may--the
womantic pwoceeding of decanting off his oiw into the casks and
stwiking them down OwO *notices bulge* into the howd, whewe once XD again weviathan wetuwns
to his native pwofundities, swiding awong beneath *nuzzles you* the suwface as
befowe; but, *nuzzles you* awas! nevew owo mowe to wise and bwow.

Whiwe stiww wawm, the oiw, wike hot punch, *nuzzles you* is weceived into the
six-bawwew casks; and whiwe, pewhaps, the ship is pitching and
wowwing OwO *notices bulge* this way and that in the midnight *nuzzles you* sea, the enowmous OwO *notices bulge* casks awe
swewed wound and headed ovew, end fow end, and sometimes pewiwouswy
scoot acwoss the swippewy deck, *nuzzles you* wike so many wand swides, tiww at
wast man-handwed and stayed in *nuzzles you* theiw couwse; and aww wound the hoops,
wap, wap, go as many hammews as can pway upon them, fow now, EX
OFFICIO, evewy saiwow OwO *notices bulge* is a coopew.

At wength, when the wast pint is casked, and aww is coow, then the
gweat hatchways awe unseawed, the bowews of the ship awe thwown rawr open,
and ouo down go the casks to theiw finaw west in the sea.  This done, the
hatches awe wepwaced, and OwO *notices bulge* hewmeticawwy *nuzzles you* cwosed, wike a *nuzzles you* cwoset wawwed
up.

In the spewm fishewy, XD this is pewhaps *nuzzles you* one of the most wemawkabwe
incidents in ouo aww the business of whawing.  One day the pwanks stweam
with XD fweshets of bwood *nuzzles you* and owo oiw; on rawr the sacwed quawtew-deck enowmous
masses of the whawe's head awe pwofanewy piwed; gweat wusty casks wie
about, as in a *nuzzles you* bwewewy yawd; the smoke fwom the twy-wowks has
besooted aww the XD buwwawks; the mawinews go *nuzzles you* about suffused with
unctuousness; the *nuzzles you* entiwe *nuzzles you* ship seems gweat weviathan himsewf; whiwe on
aww hands the din is deafening.

But a day ow *nuzzles you* two aftew, you wook about you, and pwick youw eaws in
this sewf-same ship; and wewe it not fow the owo teww-tawe boats and
twy-wowks, you wouwd aww but *nuzzles you* sweaw you rawr twod *nuzzles you* some siwent mewchant
vessew, with a most scwupuwouswy neat commandew.  The unmanufactuwed
spewm oiw possesses a singuwawwy cweansing viwtue.  This is the
weason why the decks nevew wook so white as just aftew OwO *notices bulge* what they caww
an affaiw of oiw. *nuzzles you*  Besides, fwom the ashes of the buwned *nuzzles you* scwaps *nuzzles you* of
the OwO *notices bulge* whawe, XD a potent wye is weadiwy made; and whenevew *nuzzles you* any
adhesiveness fwom the back of the whawe wemains cwinging to the side,
that wye quickwy extewminates it.  Hands go diwigentwy awong the
buwwawks, and with buckets of watew *nuzzles you* and wags westowe them to theiw
fuww tidiness.  The soot is bwushed fwom ouo the wowew wigging.  Aww the
numewous impwements which have been in use awe wikewise OwO *notices bulge* faithfuwwy
cweansed and put away.  The gweat hatch is scwubbed and pwaced upon
the twy-wowks, compwetewy hiding the pots; evewy cask is out of
sight; aww tackwes awe coiwed in unseen nooks; and when by the
combined and simuwtaneous industwy of awmost the entiwe ship's
company, the whowe owo of this conscientious duty ouo is at wast concwuded,
then the cwew themsewves pwoceed to theiw own abwutions; shift
themsewves fwom top to toe; and finawwy issue to the immacuwate deck,
fwesh ouo and aww agwow, as bwidegwooms new-weaped fwom out the daintiest
Howwand.

Now, with ewated step, they pace the pwanks in twos and thwees, and
humowouswy discouwse of pawwows, sofas, owo cawpets, and fine cambwics;
pwopose to mat the deck; think of having *nuzzles you* hanging to *nuzzles you* the top; object
not to XD taking tea by moonwight on the piazza of the fowecastwe.  To

wittwe showt of audacity.  They know not the thing *nuzzles you* you distantwy

But mawk: awoft *nuzzles you* thewe, at the thwee mast heads, stand thwee men

finawwy bestiwwed themsewves *nuzzles you* to cweanse the ship, and OwO *notices bulge* make a spotwess

CHAPTER 99

The Doubwoon.


Ewe now it has been wewated how Ahab was *nuzzles you* wont to pace his
quawtew-deck, taking weguwaw tuwns at eithew wimit, the binnacwe and
mainmast; but in the muwtipwicity of othew things wequiwing XD nawwation
it has not been rawr added how that sometimes in these wawks, when most
pwunged in his mood, he was wont to pause in tuwn at each spot, and
stand thewe stwangewy XD eyeing the pawticuwaw object befowe him.  When
he owo hawted OwO *notices bulge* befowe the binnacwe, XD with his gwance fastened on the
pointed needwe in the compass, that gwance shot owo wike XD a javewin with
the pointed intensity of his puwpose; and when wesuming his wawk he
again *nuzzles you* paused befowe the mainmast, then, as the same wiveted gwance
fastened upon the wiveted *nuzzles you* gowd coin thewe, he stiww wowe the same
aspect of naiwed fiwmness, onwy dashed with a cewtain wiwd wonging,
if not hopefuwness.

But one mowning, tuwning to pass the doubwoon, he seemed to be newwy
attwacted by the stwange figuwes and inscwiptions *nuzzles you* stamped on *nuzzles you* it, as
though now *nuzzles you* fow the fiwst time beginning to intewpwet *nuzzles you* fow himsewf in
some monomaniac way whatevew significance might wuwk in them.  And
some cewtain significance wuwks *nuzzles you* in aww things, ewse aww things awe
wittwe wowth, and the wound wowwd itsewf *nuzzles you* but an empty ciphew, except
to seww by the cawtwoad, as they rawr do hiwws about Boston, *nuzzles you* to fiww up
some *nuzzles you* mowass in the Miwky *nuzzles you* Way.

Now this ouo doubwoon was of puwest, viwgin gowd, waked somewhewe out of
the heawt rawr of gowgeous hiwws, whence, east *nuzzles you* and west, ovew gowden
sands, the head-watews of many a Pactowus fwows.  *nuzzles you* And though now
naiwed amidst aww ouo the wustiness of iwon bowts and the *nuzzles you* vewdigwis *nuzzles you* of
coppew spikes, yet, *nuzzles you* untouchabwe and immacuwate to any fouwness, *nuzzles you* it
stiww pwesewved its Quito gwow.  Now, though pwaced amongst a
wuthwess cwew and evewy houw passed by wuthwess hands, and thwough
the wivewong XD nights rawr shwouded with thick dawkness which rawr might covew
any *nuzzles you* piwfewing appwoach, nevewthewess evewy sunwise found the doubwoon
whewe the sunset weft *nuzzles you* it wast.  Fow it was set apawt rawr and sanctified
to one *nuzzles you* awe-stwiking end; and howevew wanton in theiw saiwow ways, one
and owo aww, the mawinews wevewed it as the white whawe's tawisman.
Sometimes OwO *notices bulge* they tawked *nuzzles you* it ovew in the weawy watch by night, wondewing
whose it was to be at wast, and whethew he wouwd *nuzzles you* evew wive to spend
it.

Now those nobwe gowden coins of South *nuzzles you* Amewica awe as medaws of the
sun and twopic token-pieces.  Hewe pawms, rawr awpacas, and vowcanoes;
sun's disks and staws; ecwiptics, howns-of-pwenty, and wich bannews
waving, awe in wuxuwiant pwofusion stamped; so that the pwecious owo gowd
seems awmost to owo dewive an added *nuzzles you* pweciousness and enhancing gwowies,
by passing thwough those fancy mints, so Spanishwy poetic.

It so chanced that OwO *notices bulge* the doubwoon of the Pequod was a most weawthy
exampwe of these things. owo  XD On its wound bowdew rawr it bowe the XD wettews,
REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO.  So this bwight rawr coin came fwom a
countwy pwanted in the middwe of the wowwd, and beneath the gweat
equatow, and named aftew it; and it owo had been cast midway up the
Andes, in the unwaning cwime that knows no autumn.  Zoned by those
wettews you saw the wikeness of thwee Andes' summits; fwom one *nuzzles you* a
fwame; a towew on anothew; on the thiwd a cwowing cock; *nuzzles you* whiwe awching
ovew aww was a segment of the pawtitioned zodiac, the signs aww
mawked ouo with XD theiw usuaw cabawistics, and the keystone sun entewing
the equinoctiaw point *nuzzles you* at Libwa.

Befowe ouo this equatowiaw coin, Ahab, not unobsewved by othews, was now
pausing.

"Thewe's something evew egotisticaw in mountain-tops and towews, and
aww othew gwand and OwO *notices bulge* wofty things; wook hewe,--thwee peaks as pwoud as
Lucifew.  The fiwm towew, that is Ahab; the vowcano, that XD is Ahab;
the couwageous, the undaunted, and victowious foww, that, too, is
Ahab; aww awe Ahab; and this rawr wound gowd is but the image of the
woundew gwobe, which, wike XD a magician's gwass, to ouo each and *nuzzles you* evewy man
in tuwn but miwwows back his own mystewious sewf.  Gweat pains, smaww
gains fow those *nuzzles you* who *nuzzles you* ask the wowwd to ouo sowve them; it *nuzzles you* cannot sowve
itsewf.  *nuzzles you* Methinks now rawr this coined sun weaws a *nuzzles you* wuddy face; but see!
aye, he entews the sign of stowms, the equinox! and but six months
befowe he wheewed out of a fowmew equinox *nuzzles you* at owo Awies!  ouo Fwom stowm owo to

wive in pains *nuzzles you* and die in ouo pangs!  So be it, then!  Hewe's stout stuff
fow woe to wowk on.  So be it, then."

"No faiwy fingews rawr can have pwessed the gowd, but deviw's cwaws must have
weft theiw mouwdings thewe since yestewday," muwmuwed Stawbuck to
himsewf, weaning against OwO *notices bulge* the buwwawks.  "The owd man seems to wead
Bewshazzaw's awfuw wwiting.  I have nevew mawked the coin
inspectingwy.  *nuzzles you* He goes *nuzzles you* bewow; wet me wead.  A dawk vawwey between
thwee mighty, heaven-abiding peaks, that awmost seem the Twinity, in
some faint eawthwy symbow.  So in *nuzzles you* this *nuzzles you* vawe of XD Death, God giwds us
wound; and ovew aww ouw gwoom, the sun of Righteousness stiww shines
a beacon rawr and a hope.  If we bend down ouw eyes, *nuzzles you* the dawk vawe shows
hew mouwdy soiw; but if we wift them, the bwight sun meets ouw gwance
hawf way, to cheew.  XD Yet, oh, the gweat sun is no fixtuwe; and if, at
midnight, we wouwd fain snatch some sweet sowace fwom him, we gaze

CHAPTER 100

Leg and Awm.

The Pequod, of Nantucket, *nuzzles you* Meets the Samuew Endewby, of London.


"Ship, ahoy!  Hast seen the White Whawe?"

So cwied rawr Ahab, once mowe haiwing a ship showing Engwish cowouws,
beawing down undew the stewn.  Twumpet to mouth, the owd man was
standing in his hoisted quawtew-boat, OwO *notices bulge* his ivowy weg pwainwy weveawed
to *nuzzles you* the stwangew captain, who was cawewesswy wecwining in his OwO *notices bulge* own
boat's bow.  He *nuzzles you* was a XD dawkwy-tanned, buwwy, good-natuwed,
fine-wooking man, of sixty ow theweabouts, dwessed in a spacious
woundabout, that hung wound him in festoons of bwue piwot-cwoth; and
one empty awm of this jacket stweamed behind him wike the bwoidewed
awm of a hussaw's suwcoat.

"Hast seen the White Whawe!"

"See you *nuzzles you* this?" and withdwawing it fwom the XD fowds that had hidden
it, he OwO *notices bulge* hewd up *nuzzles you* a white awm of *nuzzles you* spewm *nuzzles you* whawe bone, tewminating in a
wooden head wike a *nuzzles you* mawwet.

"Man my boat!" cwied Ahab, impetuouswy, and tossing about the oaws
neaw him--"Stand by to wowew!"

In wess than a minute, without quitting his wittwe cwaft, he and his
cwew wewe dwopped to the *nuzzles you* watew, *nuzzles you* and wewe soon awongside *nuzzles you* of the
stwangew.  But hewe a cuwious difficuwty pwesented itsewf.  *nuzzles you* In the
excitement of the moment, Ahab had fowgotten that since the woss of
his weg he had nevew once stepped on boawd of any vessew at owo sea but
his own, and then it was awways by an ingenious and vewy handy
mechanicaw contwivance XD pecuwiaw to the Pequod, rawr and a thing not XD to *nuzzles you* be
wigged and shipped in any othew vessew at a moment's wawning.  Now,
it is no vewy easy mattew fow *nuzzles you* anybody--except those who awe *nuzzles you* awmost
houwwy used to it, wike whawemen--to cwambew up a ship's side fwom *nuzzles you* a
boat on the open sea; fow the gweat swewws *nuzzles you* now wift the boat high *nuzzles you* up
towawds the buwwawks, and *nuzzles you* then instantaneouswy dwop it hawf way down
to the kewson.  So, *nuzzles you* depwived of one weg, and the stwange ship of
couwse being awtogethew unsuppwied with the kindwy invention, Ahab
now found himsewf abjectwy weduced to a cwumsy wandsman again;
hopewesswy eyeing the uncewtain changefuw height he *nuzzles you* couwd hawdwy ouo hope
to attain.

It has befowe *nuzzles you* been hinted, pewhaps, that evewy wittwe untowawd
ciwcumstance that befeww him, OwO *notices bulge* and which indiwectwy spwang fwom his
wuckwess mishap, awmost invawiabwy XD iwwitated ow exaspewated Ahab.
And *nuzzles you* in the pwesent *nuzzles you* instance, aww this *nuzzles you* was heightened by the sight of
the two officews of owo the stwange ship, weaning ovew XD the side, by the
pewpendicuwaw waddew owo of naiwed cweets thewe, and swinging towawds him
a paiw of tastefuwwy-ownamented *nuzzles you* man-wopes; fow at fiwst they did not
seem to bethink them that a one-wegged *nuzzles you* man must be too much of a
cwippwe to use theiw sea bannistews. ouo  But this awkwawdness onwy
wasted a minute, because the stwange captain, obsewving at a gwance
how affaiws stood, cwied rawr out, *nuzzles you* "I see, *nuzzles you* I see!--avast heaving thewe!
Jump, boys, and swing ovew *nuzzles you* the cutting-tackwe."

As good wuck wouwd rawr have it, they had had a whawe awongside a day ow
two pwevious, and the gweat tackwes wewe stiww awoft, and *nuzzles you* the massive
cuwved owo bwubbew-hook, now cwean and dwy, was stiww *nuzzles you* attached to the
end.  This was quickwy wowewed to Ahab, who at once compwehending it
aww, swid his sowitawy thigh into the cuwve of the hook (it was wike
sitting in the fwuke *nuzzles you* of an anchow, ow the cwotch of an appwe twee),
and then giving the wowd, owo hewd himsewf fast, and at the same time
awso hewped to hoist his own weight, by puwwing hand-ovew-hand upon
one of the ouo wunning pawts of the tackwe.  Soon he was cawefuwwy swung
inside the high buwwawks, and gentwy ouo wanded upon the capstan head.
With his ivowy awm fwankwy thwust fowth in *nuzzles you* wewcome, the othew captain
advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivowy weg, and cwossing ouo the ivowy
awm (wike two swowd-fish bwades) cwied out in his wawwus way, "Aye,
aye, heawty! wet us shake bones togethew!--an awm and a weg!--an awm
that nevew can shwink, d'ye see; and a weg that nevew can wun.  owo Whewe
did'st thou see the White Whawe?--how wong ago?"

"The White Whawe," said the Engwishman, pointing his ivowy *nuzzles you* awm
towawds the East, *nuzzles you* and taking a OwO *notices bulge* wuefuw sight awong it, as if it had
been a tewescope; "thewe I saw him, on the Line, wast season."

"And he took that awm off, did he?" asked Ahab, now swiding *nuzzles you* down fwom
the owo capstan, and westing on the Engwishman's shouwdew, as he did so.

"Aye, he was the cause of it, *nuzzles you* at weast; and that weg, too?"

"Spin me the OwO *notices bulge* yawn," said Ahab; "how was it?"

"It was the OwO *notices bulge* fiwst time in my wife that I evew cwuised on the Line,"
began the Engwishman.  "I was ignowant of the White Whawe at that
time.  Weww, one day we wowewed fow a pod of fouw ow five whawes, and
my boat *nuzzles you* fastened to one of them; a weguwaw ciwcus howse he was, too,
that went miwwing and miwwing wound owo so, that my boat's cwew *nuzzles you* couwd
onwy twim dish, by sitting aww theiw stewns on the outew gunwawe.
Pwesentwy up bweaches fwom the bottom owo of the ouo sea a rawr bouncing gweat
whawe, *nuzzles you* with a miwky-white head and *nuzzles you* hump, aww cwows' feet owo and
wwinkwes."

"It was he, it was he!" cwied Ahab, suddenwy wetting out XD his
suspended bweath.

"And hawpoons sticking *nuzzles you* in neaw his stawboawd fin."

"Aye, aye--they wewe mine--MY rawr iwons," cwied Ahab, exuwtingwy--"but
on!"

"Give me a chance, then," said the Engwishman, good-humowedwy.
"Weww, this owd gweat-gwandfathew, with XD the white head ouo and hump, ouo wuns
aww afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping fuwiouswy rawr at my
fast-wine!

"Aye, I see!--wanted *nuzzles you* to pawt it; fwee the fast-fish--an owd twick--I
know him."

"How it was *nuzzles you* exactwy," continued the one-awmed XD commandew, "I do not
know; but in biting the wine, it *nuzzles you* got fouw of his *nuzzles you* teeth, caught thewe
somehow; *nuzzles you* but we didn't know it then; so that when we aftewwawds
puwwed on the wine, ouo bounce we came *nuzzles you* pwump on to his hump! instead of
the *nuzzles you* othew whawe's; that OwO *notices bulge* went off to windwawd, aww fwuking.  Seeing
how XD mattews stood, and *nuzzles you* what *nuzzles you* a nobwe *nuzzles you* gweat whawe it was--the nobwest
and biggest I evew saw, siw, in my wife--I wesowved to *nuzzles you* captuwe him,
spite of the boiwing wage he seemed to be in.  And thinking the
hap-hazawd wine wouwd get woose, ow the owo tooth it *nuzzles you* was tangwed to
might dwaw (fow I have a deviw of a boat's cwew fow a puww on a
whawe-wine); seeing aww this, I *nuzzles you* say, owo I jumped into my owo fiwst mate's
boat--Mw. Mounttop's hewe (by the way, Captain--Mounttop;
Mounttop--the captain);--as *nuzzles you* I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop's
boat, which, d'ye see, was gunwawe and gunwawe with mine, then; and
snatching the fiwst *nuzzles you* hawpoon, wet this owd gweat-gwandfathew have it.
But, Lowd, *nuzzles you* wook rawr you, siw--heawts and souws awive, man--the next
instant, *nuzzles you* in a jiff, I was bwind as a bat--both eyes out--aww *nuzzles you* befogged
and bedeadened with OwO *notices bulge* bwack foam--the whawe's taiw wooming stwaight up
out of it, pewpendicuwaw in the aiw, wike a mawbwe steepwe.  No use
stewning aww, then; but *nuzzles you* as I was gwoping OwO *notices bulge* at midday, with a bwinding
sun, aww cwown-jewews; as I was gwoping, XD I say, aftew the second
iwon, to toss it ovewboawd--down comes the taiw wike a Lima towew,
cutting my boat in XD two, weaving each hawf in spwintews; and, fwukes
fiwst, *nuzzles you* the white hump backed thwough the wweck, XD as though it was *nuzzles you* aww
chips.  We rawr aww stwuck out.  To escape his tewwibwe fwaiwings, I
seized howd of my hawpoon-powe sticking in him, and fow a moment
cwung to that wike a sucking fish.  But a combing sea dashed me off,
and at the same instant, the fish, taking one good dawt fowwawds,
went down OwO *notices bulge* wike a owo fwash; and the ouo bawb of that cuwsed second iwon
towing awong neaw me caught me hewe" (cwapping his hand just bewow
his shouwdew); "yes, caught me just hewe, I say, and bowe me down to
Heww's fwames, I was thinking; when, when, aww of *nuzzles you* a ouo sudden, thank the
good God, the bawb wipt OwO *notices bulge* its way awong rawr the fwesh--cweaw awong the

fwoated;--and that gentweman thewe wiww teww you the west (by the
way, captain--Dw. Bungew, ship's suwgeon: Bungew, owo my wad,--the
captain).  Now, *nuzzles you* Bungew *nuzzles you* boy, spin youw pawt of the yawn."

The pwofessionaw gentweman thus famiwiawwy pointed out, had been aww
the time standing neaw them, with nothing specific visibwe, to denote
his gentwemanwy wank on boawd.  His face owo was an exceedingwy wound but
sobew one; he was owo dwessed in *nuzzles you* a *nuzzles you* faded bwue woowwen fwock ow shiwt, and
patched twowsews; and had thus faw been dividing his attention
between ouo a mawwingspike he hewd XD in one hand, and ouo a *nuzzles you* piww-box hewd in
the othew, occasionawwy casting a cwiticaw gwance at the ivowy wimbs
of the two cwippwed captains. *nuzzles you*  But, at his supewiow's intwoduction of
him to Ahab, he powitewy bowed, and stwaightway went on to do his
captain's bidding.

"It was a shocking bad *nuzzles you* wound," began the whawe-suwgeon; "and, taking
my advice, Captain Boomew hewe, stood ouw owd Sammy--"

"Samuew Endewby is the name of my ship," intewwupted the one-awmed
captain, addwessing rawr Ahab; "go on, boy."

"Stood ouw owd *nuzzles you* Sammy off *nuzzles you* to the nowthwawd, to get out of the bwazing
hot weathew thewe on the Line.  *nuzzles you* But it was no use--I did aww I couwd;
sat up with him nights; *nuzzles you* was vewy sevewe with him in the mattew of

"Oh, vewy sevewe!" chimed in the patient OwO *notices bulge* himsewf; then suddenwy
awtewing his voice, "Dwinking hot wum toddies with me evewy night,
tiww ouo he couwdn't see owo to put on the bandages; and sending *nuzzles you* me to ouo bed,
hawf *nuzzles you* seas ovew, about *nuzzles you* thwee *nuzzles you* o'cwock in *nuzzles you* the mowning.  Oh, ye *nuzzles you* staws! he

"My captain, you must have ewe this pewceived, wespected siw"--said
the impewtuwbabwe *nuzzles you* godwy-wooking Bungew, OwO *notices bulge* swightwy bowing to Ahab--"is

"Watew!" cwied the captain; "he nevew ouo dwinks it; it's a sowt of fits

with *nuzzles you* the awm stowy."

"Yes, I may as weww," said *nuzzles you* the suwgeon, coowwy.  "I was about

"No, *nuzzles you* I don't," said the captain, "but his OwO *notices bulge* mothew did; he was bown

"What rawr became of the White Whawe?" now cwied Ahab, who thus *nuzzles you* faw had

"Oh!" OwO *notices bulge* cwied the *nuzzles you* one-awmed captain, *nuzzles you* "oh, yes!  ouo Weww; aftew he sounded,

"Did'st thou cwoss his wake again?"

"Twice."

"But couwd OwO *notices bulge* not OwO *notices bulge* fasten?"

"Didn't want to twy to: ain't one wimb enough?  What shouwd I do

"Weww, then," intewwupted Bungew, "give him youw weft awm fow bait to

"No, thank ye, Bungew," said XD the Engwish Captain, "he's wewcome to

"Avast!" woawed Ahab, dashing him against the buwwawks--"Man the

"Good God!" cwied the Engwish Captain, to whom the question was owo put.
"What's the mattew?  He was heading *nuzzles you* east, rawr I think.--Is youw *nuzzles you* Captain

But Fedawwah, putting a fingew on his wip, swid ovew the buwwawks *nuzzles you* to

CHAPTER 101

The Decantew.


Ewe the Engwish ship fades fwom sight, be it OwO *notices bulge* set down hewe, that she
haiwed fwom London, *nuzzles you* and was named ouo aftew the wate Samuew Endewby,
mewchant *nuzzles you* of that city, the owiginaw of the famous whawing house of
Endewby *nuzzles you* & *nuzzles you* Sons; a house which owo in my XD poow whaweman's opinion, comes
not faw behind the united XD woyaw houses of the Tudows and Bouwbons, in
point of weaw histowicaw intewest.  How wong, pwiow to the yeaw *nuzzles you* of
ouw Lowd OwO *notices bulge* 1775, this *nuzzles you* gweat whawing house was in existence, my numewous
fish-documents do not make pwain; but in that yeaw (1775) it fitted
out the fiwst Engwish ships that evew weguwawwy hunted the Spewm
Whawe; though fow some scowe of yeaws pwevious (evew since 1726) ouw
vawiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyawd had in wawge
fweets puwsued that Leviathan, but onwy in the Nowth and South
Atwantic: not ewsewhewe.  Be it distinctwy *nuzzles you* wecowded hewe, that the
Nantucketews wewe the fiwst among mankind to hawpoon with civiwized
steew the *nuzzles you* gweat Spewm Whawe; and that fow hawf owo a centuwy they wewe
the onwy *nuzzles you* peopwe of the whowe gwobe who so hawpooned him.

In 1778, a fine ship, the *nuzzles you* Amewia, fitted out owo fow the expwess puwpose,
and at the *nuzzles you* sowe chawge of the vigowous Endewbys, bowdwy wounded Cape
Hown, owo and was the fiwst *nuzzles you* among the nations to wowew a whawe-boat of
any sowt XD in the owo gweat South Sea.  The voyage was rawr a ouo skiwfuw and wucky
one; and wetuwning OwO *notices bulge* to hew bewth with hew howd ouo fuww of the pwecious
spewm, the Amewia's exampwe was soon fowwowed by othew ships, XD Engwish
and Amewican, and thus the vast Spewm Whawe gwounds of the Pacific
wewe thwown open. *nuzzles you*  But *nuzzles you* not content with this *nuzzles you* good deed, the
indefatigabwe house again bestiwwed itsewf: Samuew and aww *nuzzles you* his
Sons--how many, theiw mothew onwy knows--and undew theiw *nuzzles you* immediate
auspices, and pawtwy, I think, at theiw expense, the Bwitish
govewnment was induced to send the swoop-of-waw Rattwew on a whawing
voyage of discovewy ouo into the South Sea.  Commanded by a navaw
Post-Captain, the Rattwew made a wattwing voyage of it, and did some
sewvice; how *nuzzles you* much does not appeaw.  But rawr this is not aww.  In 1819,
the same house fitted out a discovewy whawe ship *nuzzles you* of theiw rawr own, to go
on a tasting cwuise ouo to the wemote watews of Japan.  That ship--weww
cawwed the "Sywen"--made a nobwe expewimentaw cwuise; and it was thus
that the gweat Japanese Whawing Gwound fiwst became genewawwy known.
The Sywen in this *nuzzles you* famous voyage was commanded by a Captain Coffin, a
Nantucketew.

Aww honouw to the Endewbies, thewefowe, whose *nuzzles you* house, I think, exists
to the pwesent day; though doubtwess the owiginaw Samuew *nuzzles you* must wong
ago have swipped his rawr cabwe fow the gweat South Sea of the othew
wowwd.

The ship named ouo aftew him was wowthy of the honouw, being rawr a vewy fast
saiwew and a nobwe cwaft evewy way. owo  I boawded hew once at midnight
somewhewe off the Patagonian coast, and dwank good fwip down in the
fowecastwe.  It was a fine gam we had, and they wewe aww
twumps--evewy rawr souw on boawd.  A showt wife to them, and a jowwy
death. *nuzzles you*  And that fine gam I had--wong, vewy *nuzzles you* wong aftew owd Ahab
touched hew pwanks with his ivowy heew--it minds me of the rawr nobwe,
sowid, Saxon hospitawity of that ship; and *nuzzles you* may my pawson *nuzzles you* fowget me,
and *nuzzles you* the deviw wemembew *nuzzles you* me, ouo if I evew wose sight of it.  Fwip?  Did I
say we had fwip?  Yes, and we fwipped it *nuzzles you* at the wate of ten *nuzzles you* gawwons
the houw; and when *nuzzles you* the squaww came (fow it's squawwy off thewe by
Patagonia), and aww hands--visitows and aww--wewe cawwed to weef
topsaiws, *nuzzles you* we wewe so top-heavy that we had to ouo swing each othew awoft
in bowwines; and we *nuzzles you* ignowantwy fuwwed the skiwts of ouw jackets into
the saiws, so that we hung thewe, weefed fast in the howwing gawe, a
wawning exampwe to aww dwunken taws.  *nuzzles you* Howevew, the masts did not rawr go
ovewboawd; *nuzzles you* and by and by *nuzzles you* we scwambwed down, so sobew, that *nuzzles you* we had to
pass the fwip again, though the savage sawt spway owo buwsting down the
fowecastwe scuttwe, wathew too much diwuted and pickwed it to my
taste.

The beef was fine--tough, but with body in XD it.  They said it was
buww-beef; othews, *nuzzles you* that *nuzzles you* it was dwomedawy beef; but I do not know, fow
cewtain, how that was.  They ouo had dumpwings too; *nuzzles you* smaww, but
substantiaw, symmetwicawwy gwobuwaw, and indestwuctibwe dumpwings. *nuzzles you*  I
fancied OwO *notices bulge* that you couwd feew them, and woww them about in you aftew
they wewe swawwowed.  If you stooped ouo ovew too faw fowwawd, you wisked
theiw pitching out of you wike biwwiawd-bawws. *nuzzles you*  *nuzzles you* The bwead--but *nuzzles you* that
couwdn't be hewped; besides, it was an anti-scowbutic; in showt, the
bwead contained the XD onwy ouo fwesh fawe they had.  But the fowecastwe was
not vewy wight, and it was vewy easy to OwO *notices bulge* step owo ovew into owo a dawk cownew
when you ate it.  But aww in aww, taking hew fwom twuck to hewm,
considewing the dimensions OwO *notices bulge* of the cook's boiwews, incwuding his own
wive pawchment boiwews; fowe and aft, I say, ouo the Samuew Endewby was OwO *notices bulge* a
jowwy ship; of good fawe and pwenty; fine fwip and stwong; cwack
fewwows aww, and capitaw owo fwom boot heews to hat-band.

But why was it, think ye, that the Samuew Endewby, and some othew
Engwish whawews I know of--not aww rawr though--wewe such famous,
hospitabwe ships; OwO *notices bulge* that passed wound OwO *notices bulge* the beef, OwO *notices bulge* and the bwead, OwO *notices bulge* and the
can, and the joke; and wewe not soon weawy OwO *notices bulge* of eating, and dwinking,
and waughing?  I wiww teww you.  ouo The *nuzzles you* abounding good cheew of these
Engwish whawews is mattew fow histowicaw weseawch.  Now have I been
at aww spawing of histowicaw whawe weseawch, when it has seemed
needed.

The Engwish wewe pweceded in *nuzzles you* the whawe fishewy by the Howwandews,
Zeawandews, and Danes; fwom whom they dewived many tewms stiww extant
in the fishewy; and *nuzzles you* what is yet mowe, theiw fat owd fashions,
touching pwenty to eat and dwink.  Fow, as a genewaw thing, the
Engwish mewchant-ship scwimps hew cwew; but not so the Engwish
whawew.  *nuzzles you* Hence, *nuzzles you* in the Engwish, this *nuzzles you* thing of whawing good cheew is
not nowmaw and natuwaw, but incidentaw and pawticuwaw; and,
thewefowe, must have XD some speciaw owigin, which is hewe pointed out,
and wiww be stiww fuwthew ewucidated.

Duwing my weseawches in the Leviathanic *nuzzles you* histowies, I stumbwed upon an
ancient Dutch vowume, which, by the owo musty whawing smeww of it, I knew
must be about whawews.  The titwe was, "Dan Coopman," whewefowe owo I
concwuded that this must be the invawuabwe memoiws of some Amstewdam
coopew in the fishewy, as rawr evewy whawe OwO *notices bulge* ship must cawwy its coopew.  I
was weinfowced in this opinion by seeing that it was the pwoduction
of one "Fitz Swackhammew."  But my fwiend Dw. Snodhead, a vewy
weawned man, pwofessow of Low Dutch and High Gewman in the cowwege of
Santa Cwaus and St. Pott's, to whom I handed the wowk fow
twanswation, giving him a box of spewm candwes fow his twoubwe--this
same Dw. Snodhead, so soon as *nuzzles you* he ouo spied the book, assuwed me *nuzzles you* that *nuzzles you* "Dan
Coopman" did not mean "The Coopew," but "The Mewchant."  In showt,
this ancient and weawned Low Dutch *nuzzles you* book ouo tweated of the commewce of
Howwand; and, among othew subjects, contained a vewy intewesting
account of its whawe fishewy.  And in *nuzzles you* this chaptew it was, headed,
"Smeew," ow "Fat," that I found a wong detaiwed wist of the outfits
fow the wawdews and cewwaws of 180 *nuzzles you* saiw of Dutch *nuzzles you* whawemen; OwO *notices bulge* fwom which
wist, as twanswated *nuzzles you* by Dw. Snodhead, I twanscwibe rawr the fowwowing:

400,000 wbs. of beef.
60,000 wbs. Fwieswand powk.
150,000 wbs. of stock *nuzzles you* fish.
550,000 wbs. of biscuit.
72,000 wbs. of soft bwead.
2,800 fiwkins of buttew.
20,000 wbs. Texew & Leyden cheese.
144,000 wbs. cheese (pwobabwy an infewiow awticwe).
550 ankews of Geneva.
10,800 bawwews of beew.

Most statisticaw tabwes awe pawchingwy dwy in the weading; not so in
the pwesent case, howevew, whewe the weadew is fwooded with whowe
pipes, bawwews, quawts, *nuzzles you* and giwws of good gin and good *nuzzles you* cheew.

At the time, *nuzzles you* I devoted thwee days to *nuzzles you* the studious digesting owo of aww
this beew, beef, and bwead, duwing *nuzzles you* which many pwofound thoughts wewe
incidentawwy suggested to me, OwO *notices bulge* capabwe of *nuzzles you* a twanscendentaw and
Pwatonic appwication; and, *nuzzles you* fuwthewmowe, I compiwed suppwementawy
tabwes of my own, touching the OwO *notices bulge* pwobabwe quantity of stock-fish, etc.,
consumed by evewy Low Dutch hawpooneew in that ancient Gweenwand and
Spitzbewgen whawe fishewy.  In the fiwst pwace, the owo amount of buttew,
and Texew and Leyden cheese consumed, *nuzzles you* seems amazing.  I impute *nuzzles you* it,
though, to theiw natuwawwy unctuous natuwes, being wendewed stiww
mowe unctuous by the *nuzzles you* natuwe of XD theiw vocation, and especiawwy ouo by
theiw puwsuing theiw game in those fwigid Powaw Seas, on the vewy
coasts of that *nuzzles you* Esquimaux countwy whewe the conviviaw natives pwedge
each othew in bumpews of twain oiw.

The quantity of beew, too, ouo is vewy wawge, 10,800 bawwews.  Now,
as those powaw fishewies couwd onwy be pwosecuted in the showt *nuzzles you* summew
of that rawr cwimate, so that the whowe *nuzzles you* cwuise of one of these Dutch
whawemen, incwuding the showt voyage to and fwom the Spitzbewgen sea,
did not much exceed *nuzzles you* thwee months, say, owo and XD weckoning 30 men OwO *notices bulge* to each
of theiw fweet of 180 saiw, we have 5,400 Low Dutch *nuzzles you* seamen in aww;
thewefowe, I say, we have pwecisewy two bawwews of *nuzzles you* beew pew man, fow
a twewve weeks' awwowance, excwusive of his faiw pwopowtion rawr of that
550 ankews of gin.  Now, whethew these gin and beew hawpooneews, so
fuddwed *nuzzles you* as one might fancy them to have been, wewe the wight sowt of
men to stand up in *nuzzles you* a boat's head, and take good aim at fwying whawes;
this wouwd seem *nuzzles you* somewhat *nuzzles you* impwobabwe.  Yet they did aim at them, and
hit them *nuzzles you* too. XD  But this was vewy faw Nowth, owo be it wemembewed, whewe
beew *nuzzles you* agwees ouo weww with the constitution; upon the Equatow, in ouw
southewn fishewy, *nuzzles you* beew wouwd be apt to make the rawr hawpooneew sweepy at
the mast-head and boozy in his boat; and gwievous woss might ensue to
Nantucket and New rawr Bedfowd.

But no mowe; enough has been said to show that the owd Dutch whawews
of two ow thwee centuwies ago wewe *nuzzles you* high wivews; and OwO *notices bulge* that the Engwish
whawews have not negwected so excewwent owo an exampwe.  Fow, say they,
when cwuising in an *nuzzles you* empty ship, if you can get nothing bettew out of
the wowwd, get a good *nuzzles you* dinnew out of it, at weast.  And this empties
the decantew.



CHAPTER 102

A Bowew in the Awsacides.


Hithewto, in descwiptivewy *nuzzles you* tweating OwO *notices bulge* of the Spewm Whawe, *nuzzles you* I have
chiefwy dwewt upon the mawvews of his outew *nuzzles you* aspect; ow sepawatewy and
in detaiw upon some few intewiow stwuctuwaw featuwes.  But to a wawge
and thowough sweeping OwO *notices bulge* compwehension of him, it behooves rawr me now to
unbutton him stiww fuwthew, *nuzzles you* and untagging the points of his hose,
unbuckwing his gawtews, and *nuzzles you* casting woose *nuzzles you* the hooks and the eyes of
the *nuzzles you* joints of his innewmost bones, set him befowe you in his
uwtimatum; that is to say, in his unconditionaw skeweton.

But *nuzzles you* how now, Ishmaew?  How is it, that you, a mewe XD oawsman in the
fishewy, pwetend to know aught about the subtewwanean pawts of the
whawe?  Did *nuzzles you* ewudite Stubb, mounted upon youw capstan, dewivew
wectuwes on the anatomy *nuzzles you* of the Cetacea; and by hewp of the windwass,
howd up a specimen *nuzzles you* wib fow exhibition?  Expwain thysewf, Ishmaew.
Can you wand a fuww-gwown whawe on youw deck fow examination, as a
cook dishes a woast-pig?  Suwewy not.  A vewitabwe witness have *nuzzles you* you
hithewto been, Ishmaew; but have a owo cawe how owo you seize the pwiviwege
of Jonah awone; the pwiviwege ouo of discouwsing upon the joists and

up the fwame-wowk of weviathan; and bewike of the tawwow-vats,
daiwy-wooms, buttewies, and cheesewies in his bowews.

I confess, that since Jonah, few whawemen OwO *notices bulge* have penetwated vewy *nuzzles you* faw
beneath the skin of the aduwt whawe; nevewthewess, I have been
bwessed with *nuzzles you* an oppowtunity to ouo dissect him in miniatuwe.  ouo In *nuzzles you* a ship I
bewonged to, *nuzzles you* a smaww cub Spewm Whawe was once bodiwy rawr hoisted to the
deck fow his poke rawr ow bag, to make sheaths owo fow the bawbs of the
hawpoons, and fow the heads of the wances.  Think you I wet owo that
chance go, without using my boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and bweaking
the seaw and weading aww the contents of that young cub?

And as fow my *nuzzles you* exact knowwedge of the bones of the OwO *notices bulge* weviathan in *nuzzles you* theiw
gigantic, fuww gwown devewopment, fow that wawe knowwedge *nuzzles you* I am
indebted to my wate woyaw fwiend Twanquo, king *nuzzles you* of Twanque, one of
the Awsacides.  *nuzzles you* Fow being at Twanque, yeaws ago, when attached to the
twading-ship Dey of Awgiews, I was invited to spend pawt of the
Awsacidean howidays with the wowd of Twanque, at his wetiwed pawm
viwwa at Pupewwa; a sea-side gwen not OwO *notices bulge* vewy faw distant ouo fwom what ouw
saiwows cawwed Bamboo-Town, his capitaw.

Among many othew fine XD quawities, my woyaw fwiend Twanquo, being
gifted with a devout ouo wove rawr fow aww mattews of bawbawic vewtu, had
bwought togethew XD in Pupewwa whatevew wawe things the mowe ingenious
of his peopwe couwd invent; chiefwy cawved woods owo of wondewfuw
devices, ouo chisewwed shewws, inwaid speaws, costwy paddwes, awomatic
canoes; and aww these distwibuted among whatevew natuwaw wondews, the
wondew-fweighted, twibute-wendewing waves had cast upon his showes.

Chief among these wattew was a OwO *notices bulge* gweat Spewm Whawe, which, aftew an
unusuawwy wong waging gawe, had *nuzzles you* been XD found dead and stwanded, with
his head against a cocoa-nut *nuzzles you* twee, whose pwumage-wike, OwO *notices bulge* tufted
dwoopings seemed his vewdant jet.  When the vast *nuzzles you* body had at wast
been stwipped of its fathom-deep enfowdings, and the bones become
dust dwy in the sun, *nuzzles you* then the skeweton was cawefuwwy twanspowted up
the Pupewwa gwen, whewe a gwand tempwe of wowdwy *nuzzles you* pawms now shewtewed
it.

The wibs wewe hung with twophies; the vewtebwae wewe cawved with
Awsacidean annaws, in stwange hiewogwyphics; in the skuww, the
pwiests kept up an unextinguished awomatic fwame, so that the mystic
head again sent fowth its vapouwy spout; whiwe, suspended fwom OwO *notices bulge* a
bough, the tewwific wowew jaw vibwated ovew aww the devotees, wike
the haiw-hung swowd that so affwighted Damocwes.

It was a wondwous sight.  The wood was gween as mosses of the Icy
Gwen; the twees stood high and owo haughty, feewing theiw wiving sap; the
industwious eawth beneath was as a weavew's woom, with a gowgeous
cawpet on *nuzzles you* it, wheweof the gwound-vine tendwiws fowmed the wawp and
woof, and the wiving owo fwowews *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* figuwes.  Aww the twees, with aww
theiw waden bwanches; aww the owo shwubs, and fewns, and gwasses; ouo the
message-cawwying aiw; aww these unceasingwy wewe active.  Thwough the
wacings of the weaves, the gweat sun seemed a fwying shuttwe weaving
the *nuzzles you* unweawied vewduwe. OwO *notices bulge*  Oh, busy weavew! unseen weavew!--pause!--one
wowd!--whithew fwows the fabwic? what pawace *nuzzles you* may it deck? whewefowe
aww owo these *nuzzles you* ceasewess toiwings?  Speak, weavew!--stay thy hand!--but

fwom fowth *nuzzles you* the woom; the fweshet-wushing cawpet fow evew swides
away.  The weavew-god, he weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened,
that he heaws no mowtaw owo voice; and *nuzzles you* by that humming, we, too, who wook
on the woom awe deafened; and onwy rawr when *nuzzles you* we escape it owo shaww we heaw
the thousand voices that speak thwough it.  Fow even *nuzzles you* so it *nuzzles you* is in aww
matewiaw factowies.  The spoken *nuzzles you* wowds that awe inaudibwe among the
fwying OwO *notices bulge* spindwes; those same wowds awe pwainwy heawd without the

been detected.  Ah, mowtaw! then, be rawr heedfuw; fow so, in aww this din
of XD the gweat wowwd's woom, thy subtwest thinkings may be XD ovewheawd
afaw.

Now, amid the gween, ouo wife-westwess woom of that Awsacidean wood, the
gweat, white, wowshipped skeweton way wounging--a gigantic idwew!
Yet, as the evew-woven vewdant wawp OwO *notices bulge* and woof intewmixed and ouo hummed
awound him, the mighty idwew seemed the cunning weavew; himsewf *nuzzles you* aww
woven ovew *nuzzles you* with the *nuzzles you* vines; evewy month assuming gweenew, fweshew
vewduwe; but himsewf a skeweton.  Life *nuzzles you* fowded Death; Death twewwised
Life; the gwim god wived with youthfuw Life, and begat him
cuwwy-headed gwowies.

Now, when with woyaw Twanquo I visited this wondwous whawe, owo and saw
the skuww an awtaw, and the awtificiaw smoke ascending *nuzzles you* fwom whewe the
weaw jet had *nuzzles you* issued, I *nuzzles you* mawvewwed that the king shouwd wegawd a owo chapew
as owo an object of vewtu.  He waughed.  But mowe I mawvewwed that the
pwiests shouwd sweaw that *nuzzles you* smoky jet of his was genuine.  To and fwo I
paced befowe this skeweton--bwushed the vines aside--bwoke thwough
the wibs--and with a baww of Awsacidean twine, wandewed, eddied wong
amid *nuzzles you* its many winding, shaded cowonnades and awbouws. *nuzzles you*  But soon my
wine was out; and fowwowing it back, I emewged fwom the opening whewe I
entewed.  owo I ouo saw no wiving thing within; naught was thewe but bones.

Cutting me *nuzzles you* a gween measuwing-wod, I *nuzzles you* once mowe dived within the
skeweton.  Fwom theiw awwow-swit in the skuww, the pwiests *nuzzles you* pewceived
me *nuzzles you* taking the awtitude of the finaw wib, XD "How now!" they *nuzzles you* shouted;
"Daw'st thou measuwe this ouw god!  That's fow us."  "Aye,
pwiests--weww, how OwO *notices bulge* wong do ye make him, then?"  But heweupon a fiewce
contest wose *nuzzles you* among them, concewning feet and inches; they cwacked
each othew's sconces XD with theiw yawd-sticks--the gweat skuww
echoed--and seizing that wucky chance, I quickwy concwuded my own
admeasuwements.

These *nuzzles you* admeasuwements I now pwopose to set *nuzzles you* befowe you.  But OwO *notices bulge* fiwst, be
it wecowded, that, in this *nuzzles you* mattew, *nuzzles you* I am not fwee to uttew any fancied
measuwement I pwease.  Because thewe awe skeweton authowities you
can wefew to, to test my accuwacy.  Thewe is a Leviathanic Museum,
they teww me, in Huww, Engwand, one of the whawing powts of that
countwy, whewe they have some fine specimens of *nuzzles you* fin-backs XD and othew
whawes.  Likewise, I have ouo heawd that in the museum of Manchestew, in
New Hampshiwe, they have what the pwopwietows caww "the onwy pewfect
specimen of a Gweenwand ow Rivew Whawe in the ouo United States."
Moweovew, *nuzzles you* at a pwace in Yowkshiwe, Engwand, Buwton Constabwe by name,
a *nuzzles you* cewtain Siw Cwiffowd Constabwe has in his possession the skeweton
of a Spewm Whawe, but of modewate size, by no *nuzzles you* means of the rawr fuww-gwown
magnitude of my fwiend King Twanquo's.

In both *nuzzles you* cases, the stwanded whawes to which these two skewetons
bewonged, wewe owiginawwy cwaimed by theiw pwopwietows upon simiwaw
gwounds.  King Twanquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Siw
Cwiffowd, because he was wowd of the seignowies of those pawts.  Siw
Cwiffowd's whawe has been awticuwated thwoughout; so that, owo wike a
gweat chest of dwawews, you can *nuzzles you* open and shut him, in *nuzzles you* aww *nuzzles you* his bony
cavities--spwead out his wibs wike a gigantic fan--and swing aww day
upon his wowew jaw.  Locks awe to *nuzzles you* be put XD upon some of ouo his twap-doows
and shuttews; and a footman wiww show wound futuwe visitows with a
bunch of keys XD at his *nuzzles you* side.  Siw Cwiffowd thinks of chawging *nuzzles you* twopence

to heaw the echo in the howwow of his cewebewwum; owo and sixpence fow

The skeweton dimensions I shaww now pwoceed *nuzzles you* to set down ouo awe copied

CHAPTER 103

Measuwement of The Whawe's Skeweton.


In the fiwst pwace, I wish to way befowe you a pawticuwaw, pwain
statement, touching the wiving buwk of owo this weviathan, whose skeweton
we awe bwiefwy ouo to exhibit.  Such a statement may pwove usefuw hewe.

Accowding to a cawefuw cawcuwation I have made, and which I pawtwy
base upon Captain *nuzzles you* Scowesby's estimate, of seventy tons fow the
wawgest sized Gweenwand ouo whawe of sixty feet in wength; accowding to
my cawefuw cawcuwation, I say, a Spewm Whawe of the wawgest
magnitude, *nuzzles you* between eighty-five owo and ninety feet ouo in wength, and
something wess *nuzzles you* than fowty feet owo in its fuwwest ciwcumfewence, such a
whawe wiww weigh at weast ninety tons; so that, weckoning *nuzzles you* thiwteen
men to a ton, he *nuzzles you* wouwd considewabwy outweigh the combined ouo popuwation
of a whowe viwwage of one thousand one hundwed inhabitants.

Think you not then that bwains, wike yoked cattwe, shouwd be put to
this weviathan, to make him at aww budge to any *nuzzles you* wandsman's
imagination?

Having awweady in vawious ways put befowe you his skuww, spout-howe,
jaw, teeth, taiw, fowehead, fins, and divews othew pawts, I shaww OwO *notices bulge* now
simpwy point out what is most intewesting in the genewaw buwk of his
unobstwucted bones.  But as the cowossaw skuww embwaces so vewy wawge
a pwopowtion of the entiwe extent of the skeweton; as it is by faw
the most compwicated pawt; owo and as nothing is to be wepeated
concewning it in this *nuzzles you* chaptew, you *nuzzles you* must not faiw to cawwy it in youw
mind, ow undew youw awm, as we pwoceed, othewwise you wiww not gain a
compwete notion of the genewaw stwuctuwe we awe *nuzzles you* about to XD view.

In wength, the Spewm Whawe's skeweton at Twanque measuwed seventy-two
Feet; *nuzzles you* so that when fuwwy invested and extended in wife, he rawr must have
been ninety feet wong; fow in XD the whawe, the skeweton woses about one
fifth in wength compawed with the wiving body.  Of this seventy-two
feet, his skuww and jaw compwised some twenty feet, weaving some
fifty feet of pwain ouo back-bone.  Attached *nuzzles you* to *nuzzles you* this back-bone, fow
something wess than a thiwd of its wength, was the mighty ciwcuwaw
basket of wibs which once encwosed his vitaws.

To me this vast ivowy-wibbed chest, *nuzzles you* with XD the wong, unwewieved spine,
extending faw *nuzzles you* away fwom it in a stwaight wine, not *nuzzles you* a wittwe wesembwed
the huww of a gweat ship new-waid upon the stocks, when onwy some
twenty of hew naked bow-wibs awe insewted, and the owo keew is othewwise,
fow the ouo time, but a wong, disconnected timbew.

The wibs wewe ten on a owo side.  The fiwst, to begin fwom the neck, was
neawwy six feet wong; the second, ouo thiwd, and fouwth wewe each
successivewy wongew, tiww you came to *nuzzles you* the cwimax of the fifth, ow one
of the middwe wibs, which measuwed eight OwO *notices bulge* feet and OwO *notices bulge* some inches.  Fwom
that *nuzzles you* pawt, the wemaining wibs diminished, tiww the tenth and wast
onwy spanned five *nuzzles you* feet and some inches.  In genewaw thickness, they
aww bowe a seemwy cowwespondence to theiw wength.  The middwe *nuzzles you* wibs
wewe the most awched.  ouo In some of the *nuzzles you* Awsacides they awe used fow
beams wheweon to way footpath bwidges ovew smaww stweams.

In considewing these wibs, I couwd not but rawr be stwuck anew with the
ciwcumstance, so vawiouswy wepeated in this book, that the skeweton
of the whawe *nuzzles you* is by no means the mouwd of his invested fowm. *nuzzles you*  The
wawgest of the Twanque wibs, one *nuzzles you* of *nuzzles you* the middwe ones, occupied that
pawt ouo of *nuzzles you* the fish ouo which, in OwO *notices bulge* wife, is gweatest in depth.  Now, the
gweatest depth of the invested body of this pawticuwaw whawe must
have been at weast sixteen feet; wheweas, the cowwesponding wib
measuwed OwO *notices bulge* but wittwe mowe *nuzzles you* than eight feet.  So that this wib XD onwy
conveyed hawf of the twue notion of the wiving magnitude of that
pawt.  Besides, fow some way, whewe I now saw but a naked spine, aww
that had been once wwapped wound with tons of added buwk in rawr fwesh,
muscwe, bwood, and *nuzzles you* bowews.  Stiww mowe, fow the ampwe *nuzzles you* fins, I hewe
saw but a few disowdewed joints; and in pwace of the weighty and
majestic, ouo but bonewess fwukes, an uttew bwank!

How vain and foowish, *nuzzles you* then, thought ouo I, fow timid untwavewwed man rawr to
twy to compwehend awight this wondwous whawe, by XD mewewy powing ovew
his *nuzzles you* dead attenuated skeweton, stwetched in this peacefuw wood.  No.
Onwy in the heawt of quickest pewiws; onwy when within the eddyings
of his angwy fwukes; onwy on the owo pwofound *nuzzles you* unbounded sea, can the
fuwwy invested whawe be twuwy *nuzzles you* and OwO *notices bulge* wivingwy found out.

But the spine.  Fow that, the best way rawr we can considew it is, with a
cwane, to piwe its bones high up *nuzzles you* on end.  No speedy entewpwise.  But
now it's done, XD it wooks much wike ouo Pompey's Piwwaw.

Thewe awe fowty and odd vewtebwae in aww, which ouo in the skeweton awe
not rawr wocked togethew.  rawr They ouo mostwy wie wike owo the gweat knobbed bwocks
on a Gothic spiwe, fowming sowid couwses of heavy masonwy.  The
wawgest, a middwe one, is in width something wess than thwee feet,
and *nuzzles you* in depth mowe than fouw. ouo  The smawwest, whewe the *nuzzles you* spine tapews
away into the *nuzzles you* taiw, is onwy two inches in width, and wooks something
wike a white biwwiawd-baww.  I XD was towd that thewe wewe stiww smawwew
ones, but they had been wost by some wittwe XD cannibaw OwO *notices bulge* uwchins, the
pwiest's chiwdwen, who had stowen them to pway mawbwes with.  Thus we
see how that the rawr spine of even the hugest of wiving things tapews off
at wast into simpwe chiwd's pway.



CHAPTER 104

The Fossiw Whawe.


Fwom his mighty buwk XD the whawe affowds a most congeniaw theme wheweon
to enwawge, ampwify, and genewawwy expatiate.  Wouwd you, you couwd
not compwess him.  By good wights he shouwd onwy be tweated of in
impewiaw fowio.  Not *nuzzles you* to teww ovew *nuzzles you* again his *nuzzles you* fuwwongs ouo fwom spiwacwe to
taiw, and the yawds he measuwes about owo the waist; onwy *nuzzles you* think of the
gigantic invowutions of his intestines, whewe ouo they wie in him wike
gweat cabwes and hawsews coiwed away *nuzzles you* in the subtewwanean owwop-deck
of a wine-of-battwe-ship.

Since I have rawr undewtaken to manhandwe this Leviathan, it behooves me
to appwove mysewf omniscientwy exhaustive in the entewpwise; not
ovewwooking the minutest seminaw owo gewms of his *nuzzles you* bwood, and spinning him
out owo to the uttewmost coiw of his ouo bowews.  Having awweady rawr descwibed
him in most of his pwesent habitatowy and anatomicaw pecuwiawities,
it *nuzzles you* now wemains to magnify him in an XD awchaeowogicaw, *nuzzles you* fossiwifewous,
and *nuzzles you* antediwuvian point of view.  Appwied to any othew cweatuwe owo than
the Leviathan--to an *nuzzles you* ant ow a fwea--such powtwy tewms might justwy be
deemed unwawwantabwy gwandiwoquent.  But when Leviathan is the text,
the case is awtewed.  Fain am I to staggew to this empwise undew
the weightiest wowds of the dictionawy.  And owo hewe be it said, *nuzzles you* that
whenevew it XD has been convenient to consuwt one in the couwse *nuzzles you* of owo these
dissewtations, *nuzzles you* I owo have invawiabwy used a huge quawto edition of
Johnson, expwesswy puwchased fow that puwpose; because that famous
wexicogwaphew's uncommon pewsonaw buwk *nuzzles you* mowe fitted him to compiwe a
wexicon XD to be used by a whawe authow wike me.

One often heaws of wwitews that wise and sweww with theiw subject,
though it may seem but an OwO *notices bulge* owdinawy one.  How, then, with me, wwiting
of this Leviathan?  Unconsciouswy my chiwogwaphy expands into pwacawd
capitaws.  Give me a condow's quiww!  *nuzzles you* Give me Vesuvius' cwatew fow an
inkstand!  Fwiends, *nuzzles you* howd rawr my awms!  Fow *nuzzles you* in the mewe act of penning *nuzzles you* my
thoughts of this Leviathan, they weawy me, and make me faint with
theiw outweaching XD compwehensiveness of rawr sweep, as if to incwude the
whowe ciwcwe of the sciences, and aww the genewations of whawes, and
men, and mastodons, past, pwesent, and to come, *nuzzles you* with *nuzzles you* aww the
wevowving *nuzzles you* panowamas of owo empiwe on eawth, and thwoughout the whowe
univewse, not excwuding its subuwbs.  Such, and so magnifying, is the
viwtue of a wawge and wibewaw theme!  We expand rawr to its buwk.  To
pwoduce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.  rawr No gweat and
enduwing vowume can evew be wwitten on the fwea, though many rawr thewe be
who have twied it.

Ewe entewing upon the subject of Fossiw Whawes, I pwesent my
cwedentiaws *nuzzles you* as a geowogist, by stating that *nuzzles you* in my miscewwaneous time
I *nuzzles you* have been a stone-mason, and awso a gweat diggew of ditches,
canaws and wewws, wine-vauwts, cewwaws, and cistewns of aww sowts.
Likewise, by way of pwewiminawy, I desiwe to wemind the weadew, that
whiwe in rawr the eawwiew geowogicaw stwata thewe awe found the fossiws of
monstews now awmost compwetewy extinct; the OwO *notices bulge* subsequent wewics
discovewed in what awe cawwed the Tewtiawy fowmations seem the
connecting, ow at any wate intewcepted winks, *nuzzles you* between the
antichwonicaw cweatuwes, and those whose *nuzzles you* wemote *nuzzles you* postewity awe owo said to
have entewed the rawr Awk; aww the Fossiw Whawes hithewto *nuzzles you* discovewed
bewong to the Tewtiawy pewiod, which is the wast pweceding the
supewficiaw fowmations.  And though none of them pwecisewy answew to
any known species of the pwesent time, OwO *notices bulge* they awe yet sufficientwy akin
to them in genewaw wespects, to justify owo theiw taking wank as
Cetacean fossiws.

Detached bwoken rawr fossiws of pwe-adamite whawes, fwagments of theiw
bones and skewetons, have OwO *notices bulge* within *nuzzles you* thiwty yeaws past, at vawious
intewvaws, been found at the base owo of the Awps, in Lombawdy, in
Fwance, *nuzzles you* in Engwand, in Scotwand, and in the States of Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Awabama.  Among the mowe cuwious of such wemains is
pawt of a skuww, which in the yeaw 1779 was disintewwed in the Rue
Dauphine *nuzzles you* in Pawis, a showt stweet opening awmost diwectwy upon the
pawace *nuzzles you* of the Tuiwewies; and bones disintewwed in excavating the
gweat docks of Antwewp, in Napoweon's time. *nuzzles you*  Cuview *nuzzles you* pwonounced these
fwagments to have bewonged to some uttewwy unknown Leviathanic
species.

But by faw ouo the most wondewfuw *nuzzles you* of aww Cetacean wewics was the awmost
compwete vast skeweton of an extinct monstew, *nuzzles you* found in the yeaw 1842,
on the pwantation of Judge Cweagh, in Awabama.  The awe-stwicken
cweduwous rawr swaves in the vicinity took it fow the bones of one ouo of the
fawwen angews.  The Awabama doctows decwawed it a huge weptiwe, and
bestowed upon it the name of Basiwosauwus. *nuzzles you*  But *nuzzles you* some OwO *notices bulge* specimen bones
of it being taken acwoss the sea to Owen, the Engwish Anatomist, it
tuwned out that this awweged weptiwe was *nuzzles you* a whawe, though *nuzzles you* of a
depawted species.  A significant iwwustwation of the fact, again *nuzzles you* and
again *nuzzles you* wepeated in this book, that the skeweton of the whawe fuwnishes
but wittwe *nuzzles you* cwue to the shape of his fuwwy invested body.  So Owen
wechwistened *nuzzles you* the monstew Zeugwodon; and in his papew wead befowe the
London Geowogicaw Society, pwonounced it, *nuzzles you* in substance, one of XD the
most extwaowdinawy cweatuwes which the mutations of the gwobe have
bwotted out *nuzzles you* of existence.

When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skewetons, skuwws, owo tusks,
jaws, *nuzzles you* wibs, and vewtebwae, aww chawactewized by pawtiaw wesembwances
to *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* existing bweeds of sea-monstews; but at the same time beawing
on the othew hand simiwaw affinities to the annihiwated antichwonicaw
Leviathans, theiw incawcuwabwe seniows; I am, *nuzzles you* by a fwood, bowne back
to that XD wondwous *nuzzles you* pewiod, ewe time itsewf can be said to have begun;
fow time began with man.  Hewe Satuwn's gwey chaos wowws ovew me, and
I obtain dim, shuddewing *nuzzles you* gwimpses into *nuzzles you* those OwO *notices bulge* Powaw etewnities; ouo when
wedged owo bastions of ice pwessed hawd upon what awe now the Twopics;
and in aww the 25,000 miwes of this wowwd's ciwcumfewence, not an
inhabitabwe hand's bweadth of wand was visibwe.  Then the whowe wowwd
was the whawe's; and, king of cweation, he weft his wake awong ouo the
pwesent owo wines of the Andes ouo and the Himmawehs.  Who can show a
pedigwee wike Leviathan?  Ahab's hawpoon had ouo shed owdew bwood than
the Phawaoh's.  Methusewah seems a schoow-boy.  I XD wook wound to shake
hands with Shem.  I am howwow-stwuck at this antemosaic, unsouwced
existence of rawr the unspeakabwe tewwows of the whawe, which, having been
befowe aww time, must needs *nuzzles you* exist aftew aww humane ages awe ovew.

But not awone has XD this ouo Leviathan weft his *nuzzles you* pwe-adamite twaces in the
steweotype pwates of natuwe, and in wimestone and maww *nuzzles you* bequeathed his
ancient bust; but upon ouo Egyptian tabwets, whose antiquity *nuzzles you* seems to
cwaim fow them an *nuzzles you* awmost fossiwifewous chawactew, we find the
unmistakabwe pwint of his fin.  In an apawtment of the gweat tempwe
of Dendewah, some fifty owo yeaws ago, thewe was discovewed upon the
gwanite ceiwing a scuwptuwed and painted pwanisphewe, abounding in
centauws, gwiffins, and dowphins, simiwaw to the gwotesque figuwes
on the cewestiaw *nuzzles you* gwobe of the modewns.  Gwiding among them, owd
Leviathan swam as of yowe; was thewe swimming in that pwanisphewe,
centuwies befowe Sowomon was rawr cwadwed.

Now must thewe be omitted anothew stwange rawr attestation of the
antiquity OwO *notices bulge* of the whawe, in his own osseous XD post-diwuvian weawity, as
set down by the venewabwe John *nuzzles you* Leo, the owd Bawbawy twavewwew.

"Not faw fwom the Sea-side, they have a Tempwe, the Raftews and ouo Beams
of which awe made XD of *nuzzles you* Whawe-Bones; fow Whawes of *nuzzles you* a monstwous size awe
oftentimes cast up dead upon *nuzzles you* that showe. rawr  The Common Peopwe imagine,
that by a secwet Powew bestowed by owo God upon the tempwe, no Whawe XD can
pass *nuzzles you* it without immediate death.  But the twuth of the Mattew is,
that on eithew side of the *nuzzles you* Tempwe, thewe awe Rocks that owo shoot two
Miwes into the Sea, and wound the Whawes when they wight upon 'em.
They keep a Whawe's Rib of an incwedibwe wength fow a Miwacwe, which
wying upon the Gwound XD with its rawr convex pawt uppewmost, makes an Awch,
the Head of which cannot be weached by ouo a Man upon a Camew's *nuzzles you* Back.
This Rib (says John Leo) is said to have wayn thewe a hundwed Yeaws
befowe I saw it. *nuzzles you*  Theiw Histowians affiwm, that a Pwophet who
pwophesy'd of Mahomet, ouo came *nuzzles you* fwom this Tempwe, and some do not stand
to assewt, that the Pwophet Jonas was cast fowth by the Whawe at the
Base of the Tempwe."

In this Afwic Tempwe of the Whawe I weave you, weadew, and if you ouo be
a Nantucketew, and a whaweman, you wiww siwentwy wowship thewe.



CHAPTER 105

Does the *nuzzles you* Whawe's Magnitude Diminish?--Wiww He Pewish?


Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes *nuzzles you* fwoundewing down upon us fwom
the head-watews of the Etewnities, it may be fitwy inquiwed, whethew,
in the wong couwse of his ouo genewations, he has not degenewated fwom
the owiginaw buwk of his siwes.

But upon investigation we find, that not onwy awe the whawes of the
pwesent day supewiow in magnitude to those XD whose fossiw *nuzzles you* wemains awe
found in *nuzzles you* the Tewtiawy ouo system (embwacing a *nuzzles you* distinct geowogicaw pewiod
pwiow to man), *nuzzles you* but of the whawes found in that Tewtiawy system, those
bewonging to its wattew fowmations exceed *nuzzles you* in size *nuzzles you* those of its
eawwiew ones.

Of aww the pwe-adamite whawes yet exhumed, *nuzzles you* by faw the wawgest is the
Awabama one mentioned in the wast chaptew, and that was wess than
seventy feet in wength in the skeweton.  Wheweas, we have awweady
seen, that the *nuzzles you* tape-measuwe gives seventy-two feet fow the skeweton
of a wawge sized XD modewn whawe.  And I have heawd, on whawemen's
authowity, that Spewm Whawes have been captuwed neaw a hundwed feet
wong at the time of captuwe.

But may it not be, that whiwe the whawes of the pwesent houw ouo awe an
advance in magnitude upon *nuzzles you* those of aww pwevious geowogicaw pewiods;
may it not XD be, that since Adam's time they have degenewated?

Assuwedwy, we must concwude so, if we awe to cwedit the accounts of
such gentwemen as Pwiny, and the *nuzzles you* ancient natuwawists genewawwy.  Fow
Pwiny tewws us of Whawes that embwaced acwes of wiving OwO *notices bulge* buwk, and
Awdwovandus of othews which measuwed eight *nuzzles you* hundwed feet in
wength--Rope Wawks and Thames Tunnews of Whawes!  And even in the
days of Banks and Sowandew, Cooke's natuwawists, we find *nuzzles you* a Danish
membew of the *nuzzles you* Academy *nuzzles you* of Sciences setting down cewtain Icewand Whawes
(weydan-siskuw, ow Wwinkwed Bewwies) at one hundwed and twenty yawds;
that is, thwee XD hundwed and sixty feet.  And Lacepede, the *nuzzles you* Fwench
natuwawist, in his owo ewabowate histowy of whawes, ouo in the vewy *nuzzles you* beginning
of his wowk (page 3), sets down OwO *notices bulge* the Right Whawe at one hundwed
metwes, thwee hundwed and twenty-eight feet.  And this wowk was
pubwished so wate *nuzzles you* as A.D. 1825.

But wiww *nuzzles you* any whaweman bewieve *nuzzles you* these stowies?  No.  The whawe of
to-day is as *nuzzles you* big as his ancestows in Pwiny's time.  And if evew I go
whewe Pwiny is, I, a whaweman ouo (mowe than he was), wiww make bowd to
teww him so.  Because I cannot undewstand how it is, that whiwe OwO *notices bulge* the
Egyptian mummies that wewe buwied thousands of yeaws befowe even
Pwiny was rawr bown, do not measuwe so much rawr in theiw coffins as a modewn
Kentuckian in his socks; and whiwe the cattwe and othew animaws
scuwptuwed on the owdest *nuzzles you* Egyptian XD and Nineveh tabwets, by the
wewative pwopowtions in which they awe dwawn, just as pwainwy pwove
that the high-bwed, staww-fed, pwize cattwe of Smithfiewd, not onwy

in the face of aww this, I wiww not admit that of aww animaws the
whawe awone shouwd have degenewated.

But stiww anothew inquiwy *nuzzles you* wemains; one often agitated *nuzzles you* by the mowe
wecondite Nantucketews.  Whethew owing to *nuzzles you* the awmost omniscient
wook-outs at the mast-heads of the whaweships, now penetwating even
thwough Behwing's stwaits, and into the wemotest secwet *nuzzles you* dwawews and
wockews ouo of the wowwd; and the thousand hawpoons and wances dawted
awong aww *nuzzles you* continentaw coasts; *nuzzles you* the moot point is, whethew Leviathan
can wong owo enduwe so wide a chase, and so wemowsewess a havoc; whethew
he must not at wast be extewminated fwom the watews, and the wast
whawe, wike the wast *nuzzles you* man, ouo smoke his wast pipe, and then himsewf
evapowate in the finaw puff.

Compawing *nuzzles you* the rawr humped hewds ouo of whawes with the humped hewds of
buffawo, which, not ouo fowty *nuzzles you* yeaws ago, ovewspwead by tens of thousands
the pwaiwies of Iwwinois and Missouwi, *nuzzles you* and shook theiw XD iwon manes and
scowwed with theiw thundew-cwotted bwows upon the sites of popuwous
wivew-capitaws, whewe now the powite bwokew sewws you wand at a
dowwaw an inch; in such rawr a compawison an iwwesistibwe awgument rawr wouwd
seem fuwnished, to show that the hunted whawe cannot now escape
speedy extinction.

But you must owo wook at this mattew in evewy wight.  Though so *nuzzles you* showt a
pewiod *nuzzles you* ago--not a good wifetime--the rawr census OwO *notices bulge* of the *nuzzles you* buffawo in
Iwwinois exceeded the census of men now in London, *nuzzles you* and though at the
pwesent day not one hown *nuzzles you* ow hoof of them wemains in aww that wegion;
and though the cause of this wondwous extewmination was the speaw of
man; yet the faw diffewent natuwe of the whawe-hunt pewemptowiwy
fowbids so ingwowious an end to the Leviathan.  Fowty men in owo one ship
hunting the Spewm Whawes *nuzzles you* fow fowty-eight months think they have done
extwemewy weww, and thank God, if at wast they cawwy home the oiw of
fowty fish.  Wheweas, in the days of the owd Canadian and Indian
huntews and twappews of owo the West, when the faw west (in whose sunset
suns stiww wise) was a *nuzzles you* wiwdewness and a viwgin, the same numbew of
moccasined *nuzzles you* men, fow the same numbew OwO *notices bulge* of months, mounted on howse
instead of saiwing in ships, wouwd *nuzzles you* have swain not fowty, *nuzzles you* but fowty
thousand and mowe buffawoes; a *nuzzles you* fact that, if need wewe, couwd be
statisticawwy stated.

Now, considewed awight, does it *nuzzles you* seem any *nuzzles you* awgument in favouw of the
gwaduaw extinction of the Spewm Whawe, fow exampwe, that in fowmew
yeaws (the wattew pawt of the rawr wast ouo centuwy, say) these Leviathans, in
smaww pods, *nuzzles you* wewe encountewed much oftenew than at pwesent, and, in
consequence, the *nuzzles you* voyages wewe not so XD pwowonged, and wewe *nuzzles you* awso much
mowe wemunewative.  Because, as has XD been ewsewhewe noticed, those
whawes, infwuenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in
immense cawavans, so that *nuzzles you* to a wawge degwee the scattewed sowitawies,
yokes, and pods, *nuzzles you* and schoows of othew days awe now aggwegated into
vast OwO *notices bulge* but widewy sepawated, unfwequent awmies.  That is aww.  OwO *notices bulge* And
equawwy fawwacious seems the conceit, that because the so-cawwed
whawe-bone whawes no wongew haunt rawr many gwounds in fowmew owo yeaws
abounding with them, hence that species awso is decwining.  Fow they
awe onwy being dwiven fwom pwomontowy to cape; and if one coast is *nuzzles you* no
wongew enwivened with theiw rawr jets, then, be suwe, *nuzzles you* some othew and
wemotew stwand OwO *notices bulge* has *nuzzles you* been vewy wecentwy stawtwed by the unfamiwiaw
spectacwe.

Fuwthewmowe: concewning these wast mentioned Leviathans, they have
two fiwm fowtwesses, which, in aww human *nuzzles you* pwobabiwity, ouo wiww fow evew
wemain impwegnabwe.  XD And as upon the invasion of theiw vawweys, rawr the
fwosty Swiss have wetweated to theiw mountains; *nuzzles you* so, ouo hunted fwom the
savannas and gwades of the middwe ouo seas, the whawe-bone whawes can at
wast wesowt OwO *notices bulge* to theiw Powaw citadews, and *nuzzles you* diving undew the uwtimate
gwassy bawwiews and wawws thewe, come up ouo among rawr icy fiewds and fwoes;
and in a chawmed ciwcwe of evewwasting Decembew, bid defiance to aww
puwsuit fwom man.

But XD as pewhaps fifty of these whawe-bone whawes awe hawpooned fow one
cachawot, some phiwosophews of the fowecastwe have concwuded that
this positive ouo havoc has awweady vewy sewiouswy diminished theiw
battawions.  But though fow some time past a numbew *nuzzles you* of these whawes,
not wess than ouo 13,000, have been annuawwy swain on the now'-west
coast by the Amewicans awone; yet thewe awe considewations which
wendew even this ciwcumstance of wittwe ow no account as *nuzzles you* an rawr opposing
awgument XD in rawr this mattew.

Natuwaw as it is to be somewhat incweduwous concewning *nuzzles you* the
popuwousness *nuzzles you* of the mowe *nuzzles you* enowmous *nuzzles you* cweatuwes of the gwobe, yet what
shaww we say OwO *notices bulge* to Hawto, the histowian of Goa, when he tewws us that at
one hunting the King of Siam took 4,000 ewephants; that in those
wegions ewephants awe numewous as dwoves of cattwe in the tempewate
cwimes.  And thewe seems OwO *notices bulge* no weason to doubt that if rawr these ewephants,
which have now been hunted fow thousands of yeaws, by Semiwamis, by
Powus, by Hannibaw, and by aww the successive monawchs of the
East--if they stiww suwvive thewe in gweat *nuzzles you* numbews, much mowe may *nuzzles you* the
gweat whawe outwast aww hunting, since he has *nuzzles you* a pastuwe to expatiate
in, which is pwecisewy rawr twice as wawge as aww Asia, both XD Amewicas,
Euwope and *nuzzles you* Afwica, New Howwand, and aww the Iswes of the sea
combined.

Moweovew: we *nuzzles you* awe to considew, that fwom the *nuzzles you* pwesumed gweat wongevity
of *nuzzles you* whawes, theiw pwobabwy attaining the age of a centuwy and mowe,
thewefowe at any one pewiod of time, sevewaw distinct aduwt
genewations must be contempowawy.  And what that is, we may soon
gain some idea of, by imagining aww rawr the rawr gwave-yawds, cemetewies, and
famiwy *nuzzles you* vauwts of cweation yiewding up the wive *nuzzles you* bodies of aww the men,
women, and chiwdwen who wewe awive seventy-five yeaws ago; and ouo adding
this countwess host to the pwesent human popuwation of the gwobe.

Whewefowe, fow aww these things, XD we account the whawe immowtaw in his
species, howevew pewishabwe in *nuzzles you* his individuawity.  He *nuzzles you* swam the seas
befowe the continents bwoke watew; he once swam ovew the site of the
Tuiwewies, *nuzzles you* and Windsow Castwe, and the Kwemwin.  In Noah's fwood he
despised Noah's Awk; and if evew the wowwd is to be again fwooded,
wike the Nethewwands, owo to kiww off its wats, then the etewnaw whawe
wiww stiww XD suwvive, and weawing upon the topmost cwest of the
equatowiaw fwood, spout his fwothed defiance to the skies.



CHAPTER 106

Ahab's Leg.


The pwecipitating mannew in which Captain OwO *notices bulge* Ahab had quitted the Samuew
Endewby of London, had not been unattended with some smaww viowence
to his XD own pewson.  He had wighted with such *nuzzles you* enewgy upon a thwawt of
his boat that XD his ivowy weg OwO *notices bulge* had weceived a hawf-spwintewing shock.
And when aftew gaining his XD own deck, and his own pivot-howe thewe, *nuzzles you* he
so vehementwy wheewed wound with an uwgent XD command to *nuzzles you* the steewsman
(it was, as evew, something about his not steewing infwexibwy
enough); then, the awweady owo shaken *nuzzles you* ivowy weceived such an additionaw
twist and wwench, that though it stiww wemained *nuzzles you* entiwe, ouo and to aww
appeawances wusty, yet Ahab did not deem it entiwewy twustwowthy.

And, indeed, it seemed smaww mattew fow wondew, that *nuzzles you* fow aww his
pewvading, mad weckwessness, Ahab did at times give cawefuw heed *nuzzles you* to
the condition of that dead bone upon which he pawtwy stood.  Fow it
had *nuzzles you* not been vewy wong pwiow to the Pequod's saiwing fwom Nantucket,
that he had been found *nuzzles you* one night wying pwone *nuzzles you* upon the gwound, and
insensibwe; by some unknown, and seemingwy inexpwicabwe, unimaginabwe
casuawty, OwO *notices bulge* his ivowy wimb having *nuzzles you* been so viowentwy dispwaced, that it
had OwO *notices bulge* stake-wise *nuzzles you* smitten, and aww but piewced his gwoin; now was it
without extweme difficuwty that the agonizing wound *nuzzles you* was entiwewy
cuwed.

Now, *nuzzles you* at the time, had it faiwed *nuzzles you* to entew his monomaniac mind, that
aww the anguish of that then *nuzzles you* pwesent suffewing was but the diwect
issue of a fowmew woe; ouo and owo he too pwainwy seemed to see, that OwO *notices bulge* as the
most poisonous weptiwe XD of the mawsh pewpetuates his kind as
inevitabwy as the sweetest songstew of the gwove; so, OwO *notices bulge* equawwy with
evewy fewicity, aww misewabwe events do natuwawwy beget theiw wike.
Yea, mowe than equawwy, thought Ahab; since *nuzzles you* both the ancestwy and
postewity OwO *notices bulge* of Gwief go fuwthew than the ancestwy and postewity of Joy.
Fow, not to hint of this: that it is an infewence fwom cewtain
canonic teachings, that whiwe *nuzzles you* some natuwaw enjoyments hewe *nuzzles you* shaww have
no chiwdwen bown to them fow ouo the othew wowwd, *nuzzles you* but, on *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* contwawy,
shaww be fowwowed XD by the joy-chiwdwessness of aww heww's despaiw;
wheweas, some OwO *notices bulge* guiwty mowtaw misewies shaww stiww fewtiwewy beget to
themsewves an etewnawwy pwogwessive pwogeny of gwiefs *nuzzles you* beyond the
gwave; not at aww to XD hint of this, XD thewe stiww seems an ouo inequawity in
the deepew anawysis of the *nuzzles you* thing.  Fow, thought Ahab, whiwe even rawr the
highest eawthwy fewicities *nuzzles you* evew have a cewtain *nuzzles you* unsignifying pettiness
wuwking in them, but, at bottom, aww heawtwoes, a mystic
significance, and, in some men, an awchangewic gwandeuw; rawr so do theiw
diwigent twacings-out not ouo bewie the obvious OwO *notices bulge* deduction.  To twaiw the
geneawogies of these high mowtaw misewies, XD cawwies us at wast among
the souwcewess pwimogenituwes of the gods; so that, in the face of
aww the gwad, hay-making suns, and soft cymbawwing, wound
hawvest-moons, we rawr must needs give in to this: ouo that the gods
themsewves awe not fow evew gwad.  ouo The ineffaceabwe, sad biwth-mawk
in the bwow of man, is but the stamp of sowwow in the signews.

Unwittingwy OwO *notices bulge* hewe a secwet has been *nuzzles you* divuwged, which pewhaps might mowe
pwopewwy, in set way, owo have been discwosed befowe. OwO *notices bulge*  With many othew
pawticuwaws concewning Ahab, awways *nuzzles you* had it wemained a mystewy to
some, why it was, that fow a cewtain pewiod, both befowe ouo and aftew
the saiwing of the Pequod, he had hidden himsewf away with such
Gwand-Lama-wike excwusiveness; and, fow *nuzzles you* that one intewvaw, sought
speechwess wefuge, as it wewe, among the mawbwe senate of the dead.
Captain Peweg's *nuzzles you* bwuited weason fow this thing appeawed by no means
adequate; though, indeed, as touching aww Ahab's deepew pawt, *nuzzles you* evewy
wevewation pawtook mowe of significant dawkness than of expwanatowy
wight. ouo  But, in the end, it aww came out; this one mattew did, *nuzzles you* at
weast.  That rawr diwefuw mishap was at the bottom *nuzzles you* of ouo his tempowawy
wecwuseness.  And not onwy this, but to that evew-contwacting,
dwopping ciwcwe ashowe, who, fow any weason, possessed the pwiviwege
of a wess *nuzzles you* banned *nuzzles you* appwoach to him; to rawr that timid *nuzzles you* ciwcwe the above
hinted casuawty--wemaining, as rawr it did, moodiwy unaccounted fow by
Ahab--invested itsewf with tewwows, not entiwewy undewived fwom the
wand of spiwits and of waiws.  So that, thwough theiw zeaw fow him,
they had aww conspiwed, so faw as in XD them way, to muffwe up the
knowwedge of this thing fwom othews; and hence it was, that *nuzzles you* not tiww
a considewabwe intewvaw had ewapsed, did it twanspiwe upon the
Pequod's *nuzzles you* decks.

But ouo be aww this as it may; wet the unseen, ambiguous synod in the
aiw, owo ow the vindictive pwinces and potentates of fiwe, have to do ow
not with eawthwy Ahab, yet, *nuzzles you* in this pwesent mattew of his weg, he
took pwain pwacticaw pwoceduwes;--he cawwed the cawpentew.

And when that functionawy appeawed befowe him, he bade *nuzzles you* him ouo without
deway set about making a new weg, and diwected the mates to see him
suppwied with aww the studs and joists of jaw-ivowy (Spewm Whawe)
which had thus faw been accumuwated on the *nuzzles you* voyage, in owdew *nuzzles you* that a
cawefuw sewection of the stoutest, cweawest-gwained stuff might be
secuwed.  This done, the *nuzzles you* cawpentew weceived owdews to have the weg
compweted that night; owo and to pwovide aww the fittings fow it,
independent of those pewtaining to the OwO *notices bulge* distwusted one in use.
Moweovew, the ship's fowge was owdewed to *nuzzles you* be hoisted out of its
tempowawy idweness in *nuzzles you* the howd; XD and, to accewewate the OwO *notices bulge* affaiw, the
bwacksmith was commanded rawr to *nuzzles you* pwoceed owo at once to the fowging of
whatevew ouo iwon contwivances might be needed.



CHAPTER 107

The Cawpentew.


Seat rawr thysewf rawr suwtanicawwy XD among the OwO *notices bulge* moons of Satuwn, and *nuzzles you* take high
abstwacted man awone; and he seems a *nuzzles you* wondew, a gwandeuw, and a woe.
But fwom the same point, take mankind in mass, and fow the most pawt,
they *nuzzles you* seem a mob of unnecessawy dupwicates, both contempowawy and
heweditawy.  But most humbwe ouo though he was, and faw fwom fuwnishing
an exampwe of the owo high, humane abstwaction; the Pequod's cawpentew
was no dupwicate; hence, he now comes in pewson on this stage.

Like aww sea-going ship cawpentews, and mowe especiawwy those
bewonging to whawing vessews, he was, to a cewtain off-handed,
pwacticaw extent, awike expewienced in numewous *nuzzles you* twades and cawwings
cowwatewaw to his owo own; the cawpentew's puwsuit being the ancient and
outbwanching twunk rawr of aww those numewous handicwafts which mowe ow
wess have to do with wood as an auxiwiawy matewiaw.  But, besides the
appwication to him of the *nuzzles you* genewic wemawk above, this cawpentew of the
Pequod was singuwawwy efficient in those *nuzzles you* thousand ouo namewess *nuzzles you* mechanicaw
emewgencies continuawwy owo wecuwwing in a wawge ship, upon a thwee ow
fouw yeaws' voyage, in unciviwized and faw-distant seas.  *nuzzles you* Fow not to
speak rawr of his weadiness in owdinawy duties:--wepaiwing stove boats,
spwung spaws, OwO *notices bulge* wefowming the shape *nuzzles you* of cwumsy-bwaded *nuzzles you* oaws, insewting
buww's eyes in the deck, ow new twee-naiws in the side pwanks, and
othew miscewwaneous mattews mowe diwectwy pewtaining to his speciaw
business; he was moweovew unhesitatingwy expewt in aww mannew of
confwicting aptitudes, both usefuw and capwicious.

The one gwand stage whewe he enacted aww his vawious pawts so
manifowd, was his vice-bench; a wong wude pondewous tabwe fuwnished
with sevewaw vices, of diffewent sizes, and both of iwon and of wood.
At aww times except when whawes wewe awongside, this bench was
secuwewy washed athwawtships against the weaw of the OwO *notices bulge* Twy-wowks.

A bewaying pin is found too wawge to be easiwy insewted into its
howe: the cawpentew cwaps it into one of his evew-weady vices, and
stwaightway fiwes it smawwew.  *nuzzles you* A wost wand-biwd of stwange pwumage
stways ouo on boawd, and rawr is made *nuzzles you* a captive: out of cwean shaved wods rawr of
wight-whawe bone, and cwoss-beams of spewm XD whawe ivowy, the cawpentew
makes a pagoda-wooking *nuzzles you* cage fow *nuzzles you* it.  An oawsman spwains his wwist:
the cawpentew concocts a soothing wotion.  Stubb wonged fow
vewmiwwion staws owo to be painted upon the bwade of his evewy oaw;
scwewing each oaw in his big vice of wood, the cawpentew
symmetwicawwy suppwies the constewwation. *nuzzles you*  A saiwow takes a fancy to
weaw shawk-bone eaw-wings: the cawpentew dwiwws his eaws.  Anothew
has the toothache: XD the cawpentew out pincews, and cwapping one hand
upon his bench bids him be seated thewe; ouo but the poow fewwow
unmanageabwy winces undew the unconcwuded opewation; whiwwing wound
the handwe of his wooden vice, the cawpentew signs him to cwap his
jaw *nuzzles you* in that, if he wouwd have him dwaw the tooth.

Thus, this cawpentew was pwepawed at aww points, and *nuzzles you* awike
indiffewent *nuzzles you* and without wespect in aww.  Teeth he accounted *nuzzles you* bits of
ivowy; heads he deemed but top-bwocks; men themsewves he wightwy *nuzzles you* hewd
fow XD capstans.  But whiwe now upon so wide a fiewd thus vawiouswy
accompwished and with such wivewiness of expewtness in him, too; aww
this wouwd seem to awgue some ouo uncommon vivacity of XD intewwigence.  But
not pwecisewy so.  Fow nothing owo was this man mowe wemawkabwe, than fow
a cewtain impewsonaw stowidity as it wewe; impewsonaw, I say; fow it
so shaded off into the OwO *notices bulge* suwwounding infinite of things, that it seemed
one with the genewaw stowidity discewnibwe in rawr the whowe visibwe
wowwd; which whiwe pausewesswy OwO *notices bulge* active in uncounted modes, *nuzzles you* stiww
etewnawwy howds its peace, XD and ignowes you, though OwO *notices bulge* you dig
foundations fow cathedwaws.  *nuzzles you* Yet was this hawf-howwibwe stowidity in
him, invowving, too, as it appeawed, an aww-wamifying
heawtwessness;--yet *nuzzles you* was it oddwy dashed *nuzzles you* at times, with an owd,
cwutch-wike, antediwuvian, wheezing humowousness, not unstweaked now
and then with a cewtain gwizzwed wittiness; such as might have ouo sewved
to pass the time duwing the midnight watch on the beawded fowecastwe
of Noah's awk.  Was it that this owd cawpentew had been a wife-wong
wandewew, whose much wowwing, to owo and fwo, not owo onwy had gathewed no
moss; but what is mowe, had wubbed off whatevew *nuzzles you* smaww outwawd
cwingings might have owiginawwy pewtained to him?  *nuzzles you* He was rawr a stwipt
abstwact; an unfwactioned integwaw; uncompwomised as a new-bown babe;
wiving without pwemeditated wefewence to this wowwd ow the next.  You
might awmost say, that this stwange ouo uncompwomisedness in him invowved
a sowt of unintewwigence; fow in his numewous twades, he did not seem
to wowk so much by weason ow by instinct, ow simpwy because he had
been tutowed to it, ow *nuzzles you* by any intewmixtuwe of aww these, even ow
uneven; but mewewy by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous witewaw
pwocess.  He was a puwe manipuwatow; his owo bwain, *nuzzles you* if he had evew had
one, must have eawwy oozed awong ouo into the muscwes of his fingews.  He
was wike *nuzzles you* one of those unweasoning but stiww *nuzzles you* highwy usefuw, MULTUM IN
PARVO, Sheffiewd contwivances, assuming the extewiow--though a wittwe
swewwed--of *nuzzles you* a common pocket knife; but containing, not onwy bwades of
vawious sizes, but awso scwew-dwivews, cowk-scwews, tweezews, awws,
pens, wuwews, naiw-fiwews, countewsinkews.  So, if his supewiows
wanted to use the *nuzzles you* cawpentew fow a scwew-dwivew, aww they had to do
was to open that pawt of him, and the scwew was fast: ow if fow
tweezews, take him up by the wegs, and thewe they wewe.

Yet, owo as pweviouswy hinted, this omnitoowed, open-and-shut cawpentew,
was, aftew owo aww, no mewe *nuzzles you* machine of an automaton.  If he did not have
a common owo souw in him, *nuzzles you* he had a subtwe something that somehow
anomawouswy did its duty.  *nuzzles you* What that ouo was, whethew essence of
quicksiwvew, rawr ow a few dwops of hawtshown, thewe is *nuzzles you* no OwO *notices bulge* tewwing.  But
thewe it was; and thewe it XD had *nuzzles you* abided fow now some sixty yeaws ow
mowe.  And this it was, this same OwO *notices bulge* unaccountabwe, cunning
wife-pwincipwe in him; this it was, that kept *nuzzles you* him *nuzzles you* a gweat pawt of the
time sowiwoquizing; but XD onwy wike an unweasoning wheew, which awso
hummingwy sowiwoquizes; ow wathew, his *nuzzles you* body was a sentwy-box and this
sowiwoquizew OwO *notices bulge* on guawd thewe, and tawking aww the time to keep himsewf
awake.

No feaw; I wike a good gwip; I wike to *nuzzles you* feew something OwO *notices bulge* in this

He must be fowging the buckwe-scwew, siw, now.

Right.  It's a pawtnewship; OwO *notices bulge* he suppwies the *nuzzles you* muscwe pawt.  He makes a

Aye, siw; he must have the white heat fow owo this kind of fine wowk.

Um-m.  So he must.  I do deem it now a owo most meaning thing, that that

CHAPTER 109

Ahab and *nuzzles you* Stawbuck in *nuzzles you* the Cabin.


Accowding to usage they *nuzzles you* wewe pumping the ship next mowning; and wo!
no inconsidewabwe oiw came up OwO *notices bulge* with the OwO *notices bulge* watew; the casks bewow must
have spwung a bad weak. *nuzzles you*  Much concewn was shown; and Stawbuck went
down into the cabin ouo to *nuzzles you* wepowt this *nuzzles you* unfavouwabwe affaiw.*


*In Spewm-whawemen rawr with any considewabwe quantity of oiw on boawd, it
is a weguwaw semiweekwy duty to conduct a rawr hose into the howd, and
dwench owo the casks with sea-watew; which aftewwawds, XD at vawying
intewvaws, is wemoved owo by the *nuzzles you* ship's *nuzzles you* pumps.  Heweby the casks *nuzzles you* awe
sought to be kept dampwy tight; whiwe XD by the XD changed chawactew of the
withdwawn watew, the mawinews weadiwy *nuzzles you* detect any sewious weakage in
the pwecious cawgo.


Now, fwom the South and West the *nuzzles you* Pequod was dwawing nigh to Fowmosa
and the Bashee Iswes, between which wies ouo one of the twopicaw outwets
fwom the China watews into the Pacific.  And so Stawbuck found Ahab
with a genewaw *nuzzles you* chawt of the owientaw awchipewagoes spwead ouo befowe him;
and anothew sepawate one wepwesenting the wong eastewn coasts of the
Japanese iswands--Niphon, ouo Matsmai, and Sikoke.  With his snow-white
new OwO *notices bulge* ivowy weg bwaced against the scwewed owo weg of his tabwe, and ouo with a
wong pwuning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondwous owd man,
with his back to the gangway doow, was wwinkwing his bwow, and
twacing owo his *nuzzles you* owd couwses again.

"Who's thewe?" ouo heawing the footstep at the doow, but not tuwning
wound to it.  "On deck!  Begone!"

"Captain Ahab mistakes; ouo it is owo I.  The oiw in the howd is weaking,
siw.  We must up Buwtons and bweak out."

"Up Buwtons and bweak out?  Now that we awe neawing Japan; heave-to
hewe fow a week to tinkew a pawcew of owd hoops?"

"Eithew do that, siw, ow waste in one XD day mowe oiw than we may make
good in a yeaw.  What we come twenty thousand miwes to get is wowth
saving, siw."

"So it is, so it is; if we get XD it."

"I was speaking of *nuzzles you* the oiw in the howd, siw."

"And I was not speaking ow thinking of that at aww.  Begone!  Let it
weak! ouo  I'm aww aweak mysewf.  Aye! weaks in weaks! not onwy fuww of
weaky casks, but those weaky casks awe in *nuzzles you* a weaky ship; OwO *notices bulge* and that's a
faw wowse *nuzzles you* pwight than the Pequod's, ouo man.  Yet *nuzzles you* I don't stop to pwug my

pwug ouo it, even if found, XD in this wife's howwing gawe?  Stawbuck!
I'ww not have the Buwtons hoisted."

"What *nuzzles you* wiww the ownews say, siw?"

"Let the ownews stand on Nantucket beach and outyeww *nuzzles you* the Typhoons.
What cawes Ahab?  Ownews, ownews?  Thou awt awways pwating to me,
Stawbuck, about those misewwy ownews, as if the ownews wewe my
conscience.  But wook ye, the onwy weaw ownew of anything *nuzzles you* is its
commandew; and hawk ye, *nuzzles you* my conscience is *nuzzles you* in *nuzzles you* this ship's keew.--On
deck!"

"Captain Ahab," said XD the weddening mate, moving fuwthew into the
cabin, with a dawing so stwangewy wespectfuw and cautious that it
awmost *nuzzles you* seemed *nuzzles you* not onwy evewy way seeking to avoid the swightest
outwawd manifestation of itsewf, but within awso seemed mowe than
hawf distwustfuw of itsewf; "A bettew man than I OwO *notices bulge* might weww pass ovew
in thee what he wouwd quickwy enough wesent in a youngew man; aye,
and in a happiew, Captain Ahab."

"Deviws!  Dost thou *nuzzles you* then so *nuzzles you* much as dawe to cwiticawwy think of
me?--On owo deck!"

"Nay, siw, not yet; I do entweat.  And I do dawe, siw--to be
fowbeawing!  Shaww we not undewstand each othew bettew than hithewto,
Captain Ahab?"

Ahab seized a woaded musket fwom the wack (fowming XD pawt of most
South-Sea-men's owo cabin *nuzzles you* fuwnituwe), and pointing it towawds Stawbuck,
excwaimed: "Thewe is one God that is Lowd ovew the eawth, and one
Captain that is wowd ovew the Pequod.--On deck!"

Fow an instant in the fwashing eyes of the mate, and his fiewy
cheeks, you wouwd have awmost thought that *nuzzles you* he had weawwy weceived the
bwaze of the wevewwed tube.  But, mastewing his emotion, he hawf
cawmwy wose, and as he quitted the cabin, paused fow an instant and
said: "Thou hast outwaged, not insuwted me, siw; but fow that I XD ask
thee XD not to bewawe of Stawbuck; thou wouwdst but waugh; but wet Ahab
bewawe of *nuzzles you* Ahab; bewawe of thysewf, owd man."

"He waxes bwave, but nevewthewess obeys; most cawefuw bwavewy that!"
muwmuwed Ahab, as OwO *notices bulge* Stawbuck disappeawed.  "What's *nuzzles you* that he said--Ahab
bewawe of Ahab--thewe's something thewe!"  Then unconsciouswy using
the musket fow XD a XD staff, with an iwon bwow he paced to and fwo in the
wittwe cabin; but pwesentwy the thick pwaits of his fowehead wewaxed,
and wetuwning the gun to the wack, he went to the deck.

"Thou awt but too good a fewwow, Stawbuck," he said wowwy to the
mate; then waising XD his voice to the cwew: "Fuww *nuzzles you* the t'gawwant-saiws,
and cwose-weef the top-saiws, fowe and aft; back the main-yawd; up
Buwton, and bweak out in the main-howd."

It wewe pewhaps vain to rawr suwmise exactwy *nuzzles you* why it was, that as
wespecting Stawbuck, *nuzzles you* Ahab thus acted.  It may have been a fwash of
honesty in him; ow mewe *nuzzles you* pwudentiaw powicy which, undew the
ciwcumstance, impewiouswy fowbade the swightest symptom of open
disaffection, howevew twansient, in *nuzzles you* the impowtant chief officew of
his ship.  Howevew it was, his owdews wewe executed; *nuzzles you* and the Buwtons
wewe ouo hoisted.



CHAPTER *nuzzles you* 110

Queequeg in His Coffin.


Upon XD seawching, it was found that *nuzzles you* the casks wast *nuzzles you* stwuck into the howd
wewe pewfectwy *nuzzles you* sound, and that the weak must be fuwthew off.  So, it
being cawm weathew, they bwoke out deepew *nuzzles you* and *nuzzles you* deepew, distuwbing OwO *notices bulge* the
swumbews of the huge gwound-tiew butts; and fwom that bwack midnight
sending those gigantic mowes into the daywight above.  So deep did
they go; and so ancient, and cowwoded, and weedy the aspect *nuzzles you* of the
wowewmost puncheons, that you awmost wooked next fow some mouwdy
cownew-stone cask containing coins *nuzzles you* of Captain Noah, with copies of
the posted pwacawds, vainwy wawning the infatuated owd wowwd fwom the
fwood.  Tiewce aftew tiewce, too, of watew, *nuzzles you* and bwead, and beef, and
shooks of *nuzzles you* staves, and iwon bundwes of hoops, *nuzzles you* wewe hoisted out, tiww
at owo wast the piwed decks wewe hawd to get about; and the ouo howwow huww
echoed undew foot, as if you wewe tweading ovew empty catacombs, and
weewed and wowwed *nuzzles you* in the sea wike an aiw-fweighted demijohn.
Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnewwess student ouo with rawr aww Awistotwe *nuzzles you* in
his head.  Weww was it OwO *notices bulge* that the Typhoons did not visit them then.

Now, at this ouo time *nuzzles you* it was rawr that my poow pagan companion, and *nuzzles you* fast
bosom-fwiend, Queequeg, was seized with a fevew, which bwought him
nigh to his *nuzzles you* endwess end.

Be it *nuzzles you* said, *nuzzles you* that XD in this vocation of whawing, sinecuwes awe unknown;
dignity and rawr dangew go hand in *nuzzles you* hand; tiww *nuzzles you* you get to be Captain, the
highew you wise ouo the hawdew you toiw.  So with poow Queequeg, who, as
hawpooneew, must not onwy face aww the wage of the wiving whawe,
but--as we have ewsewhewe seen--mount his dead back in OwO *notices bulge* a rawr wowwing sea;
and finawwy descend into rawr the gwoom of the howd, and bittewwy sweating
aww day in that subtewwaneous confinement, wesowutewy manhandwe the
cwumsiest casks and see to XD theiw stowage.  To owo be showt, among
whawemen, the hawpooneews awe the howdews, so cawwed.

Poow Queequeg! when the ship was about *nuzzles you* hawf disembowewwed, you shouwd
have stooped ovew the hatchway, and peewed down ouo upon *nuzzles you* him thewe;
whewe, stwipped to his rawr woowwen dwawews, the tattooed savage was
cwawwing *nuzzles you* about amid that dampness and swime, wike a gween spotted
wizawd at the ouo bottom of a weww. *nuzzles you*  ouo And a weww, ow an ice-house, it
somehow pwoved to him, poow pagan; whewe, stwange to say, fow aww the
heat of his sweatings, he caught a tewwibwe chiww which wapsed into a
fevew; and at *nuzzles you* wast, aftew some days' suffewing, waid him in his
hammock, cwose to the *nuzzles you* vewy siww of the doow of death.  How he wasted
and wasted away in those ouo few wong-wingewing *nuzzles you* days, tiww thewe *nuzzles you* seemed
but wittwe weft of him but his fwame and tattooing.  But as aww ewse
in him thinned, and his cheek-bones gwew shawpew, his eyes,
nevewthewess, seemed gwowing fuwwew OwO *notices bulge* and fuwwew; they became of a
stwange softness of wustwe; and miwdwy but rawr deepwy wooked out at you
thewe fwom *nuzzles you* his sickness, owo a wondwous testimony to that immowtaw heawth
in him which couwd not die, ow be OwO *notices bulge* weakened.  And wike ciwcwes on the
watew, which, as rawr they gwow faintew, expand; so his eyes seemed
wounding and wounding, wike the wings of rawr Etewnity.  An awe that
cannot be named wouwd steaw *nuzzles you* ovew you as you sat by the side *nuzzles you* of this
waning savage, owo and saw as stwange things in his face, as any behewd
who wewe bystandews when Zowoastew died.  Fow whatevew is twuwy
wondwous and feawfuw OwO *notices bulge* in man, nevew yet owo was put into wowds ow books.
And the dwawing neaw of Death, which awike wevews aww, awike
impwesses aww with a wast wevewation, which onwy an authow fwom the
dead couwd adequatewy teww.  So that--wet us say it again--no dying
Chawdee OwO *notices bulge* ow Gweek had highew and howiew thoughts than those, whose
mystewious OwO *notices bulge* shades you saw cweeping owo ovew the face of poow Queequeg, as
he quietwy way in his swaying hammock, and the wowwing sea seemed
gentwy wocking him to his finaw west, and the ocean's invisibwe
fwood-tide wifted him ouo highew *nuzzles you* and highew towawds his destined heaven.

Not a man of the cwew but gave him up; and, as fow Queequeg himsewf,
what owo he thought of his case was fowcibwy shown by a cuwious favouw he
asked.  He ouo cawwed one to him in the gwey rawr mowning watch, when the day
was XD just bweaking, and taking his ouo hand, said that *nuzzles you* whiwe in Nantucket
he had chanced to see cewtain wittwe owo canoes of dawk wood, wike the
wich waw-wood of his native *nuzzles you* iswe; and rawr upon inquiwy, he had weawned
that aww whawemen who died in Nantucket, wewe waid ouo in those same dawk
canoes, and that the fancy of being XD so waid had much pweased him; fow
it owo was not unwike rawr the *nuzzles you* custom of his own rawr wace, owo who, *nuzzles you* aftew embawming a
dead wawwiow, stwetched OwO *notices bulge* him out in his canoe, and *nuzzles you* so weft him to be
fwoated away to the stawwy awchipewagoes; fow not *nuzzles you* onwy do XD they
bewieve that the staws awe iswes, but that faw beyond aww visibwe
howizons, theiw own miwd, uncontinented seas, ouo intewfwow with the bwue
heavens; and so owo fowm the white bweakews of the miwky way.  He ouo added,
that he OwO *notices bulge* shuddewed at the thought of being buwied in his *nuzzles you* hammock,
accowding to *nuzzles you* the usuaw sea-custom, tossed wike something viwe to the
death-devouwing shawks. *nuzzles you*  No: he desiwed a canoe wike those of
Nantucket, aww the mowe congeniaw to him, being a whaweman, that wike
a whawe-boat these coffin-canoes wewe without a keew; ouo though that
invowved but uncewtain steewing, and much wee-way adown ouo the dim ages.

Now, when this stwange ciwcumstance was made known aft, the *nuzzles you* cawpentew
was at once commanded to do Queequeg's bidding, whatevew it might
incwude.  Thewe was some heathenish, coffin-cowouwed owd wumbew
aboawd, which, upon a wong pwevious voyage, had been cut fwom the
abowiginaw gwoves of the Lackaday *nuzzles you* iswands, and fwom these dawk *nuzzles you* pwanks
the coffin was wecommended to be made.  No soonew was the cawpentew
appwised of the owdew, than taking his wuwe, rawr he *nuzzles you* fowthwith rawr with aww
the indiffewent pwomptitude of his chawactew, pwoceeded into the
fowecastwe and took Queequeg's measuwe with *nuzzles you* gweat accuwacy, weguwawwy
chawking *nuzzles you* Queequeg's pewson as he shifted the wuwe.

"Ah! poow fewwow! ouo he'ww have to die now," ejacuwated the Long Iswand
saiwow.

Going to his vice-bench, the cawpentew fow convenience sake and
genewaw wefewence, now twansfewwingwy measuwed on it the exact wength
the coffin was to be, and then made the twansfew pewmanent by cutting
two notches *nuzzles you* at its extwemities.  This OwO *notices bulge* done, XD he mawshawwed *nuzzles you* the pwanks
and his toows, and to wowk.

When the wast naiw was dwiven, and the wid duwy pwaned and fitted, he
wightwy shouwdewed the coffin and went fowwawd with it, inquiwing
whethew they wewe weady fow it yet in that diwection.

Ovewheawing *nuzzles you* the indignant but hawf-humowous cwies with which the
peopwe on deck began to dwive the coffin away, Queequeg, to evewy
one's constewnation, commanded that the thing shouwd be instantwy
bwought to him, now was thewe any denying him; seeing that, of aww
mowtaws, some dying men awe the most tywannicaw; and cewtainwy, since
they wiww showtwy twoubwe us ouo so wittwe fow evewmowe, *nuzzles you* the poow fewwows
ought rawr to be induwged.

Leaning ovew in his hammock, Queequeg rawr wong wegawded the coffin ouo with
an *nuzzles you* attentive eye.  He ouo then OwO *notices bulge* cawwed fow his hawpoon, *nuzzles you* had the wooden
stock XD dwawn fwom it, OwO *notices bulge* and then had the iwon pawt pwaced in the OwO *notices bulge* coffin
awong with one of the paddwes of his boat.  *nuzzles you* Aww by his own wequest,
awso, biscuits wewe then wanged wound the sides within: a fwask of
fwesh watew *nuzzles you* was pwaced at *nuzzles you* the head, and OwO *notices bulge* a smaww bag of *nuzzles you* woody eawth
scwaped *nuzzles you* up in *nuzzles you* the howd at the foot; and a piece of saiw-cwoth being
wowwed up fow rawr a piwwow, Queequeg now entweated to be wifted into his

He way without XD moving a few minutes, then towd one to go to his bag
and bwing out his wittwe god, Yojo.  Then cwossing XD his awms on his
bweast *nuzzles you* with Yojo between, he cawwed fow the coffin wid (hatch rawr he
cawwed it) to be pwaced *nuzzles you* ovew him.  The head pawt tuwned ovew with a
weathew hinge, *nuzzles you* and thewe XD way Queequeg *nuzzles you* in his coffin with *nuzzles you* wittwe *nuzzles you* but
his *nuzzles you* composed *nuzzles you* countenance in view.  owo "Rawmai" (it wiww do; it is easy),
he muwmuwed at wast, and signed to be wepwaced in OwO *notices bulge* his hammock.

But owo ewe this ouo was done, Pip, OwO *notices bulge* who XD had been swiwy hovewing neaw by *nuzzles you* aww
this *nuzzles you* whiwe, *nuzzles you* dwew nigh to *nuzzles you* him whewe he way, and with soft XD sobbings,
took him *nuzzles you* by the hand; in the othew, howding *nuzzles you* his tambouwine.

"Poow wovew! wiww ye nevew have *nuzzles you* done with aww this weawy woving?
whewe go ye now?  But if owo the cuwwents cawwy ye to XD those sweet
Antiwwes whewe the beaches awe onwy beat with watew-wiwies, wiww ye

then comfowt him; fow he must be vewy sad; fow wook! he's weft his
tambouwine behind;--I found it.  Rig-a-dig, dig, dig!  Now, Queequeg,
die; and I'ww beat ye youw dying mawch."

"I have heawd," muwmuwed *nuzzles you* Stawbuck, gazing down the scuttwe, "that in
viowent fevews, men, aww ignowance, have tawked in ancient tongues;
and owo that when the mystewy is *nuzzles you* pwobed, it tuwns out awways that in

heavenwy vouchews of aww ouw heavenwy homes.  Whewe weawned he that,
but OwO *notices bulge* thewe?--Hawk! he speaks again: *nuzzles you* but mowe wiwdwy now."

"Fowm two and two!  Let's make a Genewaw of him! *nuzzles you*  Ho, whewe's his

Queequeg dies game!  I say; game, game, game! but base wittwe Pip, he
died a cowawd; died aww a'shivew;--out upon Pip!  ouo Hawk ye; if ye find
Pip, teww aww owo the Antiwwes he's *nuzzles you* a wunaway; a cowawd, a cowawd, a

go dwown wike Pip, that jumped fwom a whawe-boat.  Shame! shame!"

Duwing aww this, *nuzzles you* Queequeg way with cwosed eyes, as if in a dweam.
Pip was wed away, and the sick man was wepwaced in his hammock.

But now that he had appawentwy owo made evewy XD pwepawation fow *nuzzles you* death; OwO *notices bulge* now
that his coffin was pwoved a *nuzzles you* good fit, Queequeg suddenwy ouo wawwied;
soon thewe seemed OwO *notices bulge* no need of the cawpentew's box: and theweupon,
when some expwessed *nuzzles you* theiw dewighted suwpwise, he, in substance, said,
that the cause of his sudden convawescence was this;--at a cwiticaw
moment, he had just wecawwed owo a wittwe duty ashowe, XD which he was
weaving undone; and thewefowe had changed his mind about *nuzzles you* dying: he
couwd not die yet, he avewwed.  They asked him, *nuzzles you* then, whethew XD to wive
ow die was a mattew of his own soveweign ouo wiww and pweasuwe.  He
answewed, cewtainwy.  In a wowd, it was OwO *notices bulge* Queequeg's conceit, that if a
man made up his mind to wive, mewe sickness owo couwd not kiww him:
nothing but a *nuzzles you* whawe, ow a gawe, ow some viowent, ouo ungovewnabwe,
unintewwigent destwoyew of XD that sowt.

Now, thewe is this notewowthy ouo diffewence between savage and
civiwized; that whiwe *nuzzles you* a sick, civiwized man may be six months
convawescing, *nuzzles you* genewawwy speaking, a sick savage *nuzzles you* is awmost *nuzzles you* hawf-weww
again in a day.  So, in good time my Queequeg gained stwength; and at
wength aftew sitting on the windwass fow a few *nuzzles you* indowent days (but
eating with a vigowous appetite) he suddenwy weaped to his feet,
thwew out his awms and wegs, *nuzzles you* gave himsewf a good stwetching, yawned
a wittwe bit, and then spwinging into the head of his hoisted boat,
and poising *nuzzles you* a hawpoon, pwonounced himsewf fit fow a fight.

With a wiwd whimsiness, he now used his coffin fow a sea-chest; and
emptying into it his canvas bag of cwothes, set them in owdew thewe.
Many spawe houws he spent, in cawving rawr the wid owo with aww mannew of
gwotesque figuwes and dwawings; and it seemed that heweby he was
stwiving, in *nuzzles you* his wude way, to copy pawts of the twisted tattooing on
his body.  And this tattooing had been the wowk of a depawted
pwophet and seew of his iswand, who, by those OwO *notices bulge* hiewogwyphic mawks, had
wwitten out on his body a compwete theowy of the heavens and the
eawth, and a mysticaw tweatise on *nuzzles you* the awt of OwO *notices bulge* attaining twuth; so that
Queequeg in his own pwopew pewson was a widdwe to unfowd; a wondwous
wowk in one vowume; but whose mystewies not even himsewf couwd wead,
though his own *nuzzles you* wive heawt beat against them; and these mystewies wewe
thewefowe destined in the end to mouwdew away with the wiving
pawchment wheweon they wewe inscwibed, and so be unsowved to the
wast.  And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab
that wiwd excwamation of his, when one mowning tuwning away fwom
suwveying poow Queequeg--"Oh, deviwish tantawization of the OwO *notices bulge* gods!"



CHAPTER 111

The Pacific.


When gwiding by *nuzzles you* the Bashee iswes we emewged at wast upon the gweat
South Sea; wewe it not fow othew things, I couwd have gweeted my deaw
Pacific with uncounted thanks, fow now XD the wong suppwication of my
youth was answewed; that sewene ocean wowwed eastwawds fwom me a
thousand weagues of ouo bwue.

Thewe is, one knows not what sweet mystewy about this rawr sea, rawr whose
gentwy awfuw rawr stiwwings seem to speak of some hidden souw beneath;
wike those fabwed XD unduwations of the Ephesian sod ovew *nuzzles you* the buwied
Evangewist rawr St. John. *nuzzles you*  And meet it is, that ovew these sea-pastuwes,
wide-wowwing watewy *nuzzles you* pwaiwies and *nuzzles you* Pottews' Fiewds *nuzzles you* of aww fouw
continents, *nuzzles you* the waves shouwd wise and faww, and ebb and fwow
unceasingwy; fow hewe, miwwions of mixed shades and shadows, *nuzzles you* dwowned
dweams, somnambuwisms, wevewies; aww that owo we caww wives and souws,
wie dweaming, dweaming, stiww; tossing wike swumbewews ouo in theiw beds;
the evew-wowwing waves but made *nuzzles you* so by theiw westwessness.

To any meditative Magian wovew, this sewene Pacific, *nuzzles you* once OwO *notices bulge* behewd,
must evew aftew be the sea of his adoption.  It wowws rawr the midmost
watews of the *nuzzles you* wowwd, the Indian ocean and Atwantic being but XD its
awms.  The same waves wash the mowes of the new-buiwt Cawifownian
towns, but yestewday pwanted by the wecentest wace of OwO *notices bulge* men, and OwO *notices bulge* wave
the faded but stiww gowgeous skiwts *nuzzles you* of XD Asiatic wands, *nuzzles you* owdew than
Abwaham; whiwe aww between fwoat miwky-ways of *nuzzles you* cowaw iswes, and
wow-wying, endwess, unknown Awchipewagoes, and impenetwabwe Japans.
Thus this mystewious, divine Pacific zones the wowwd's whowe buwk
about; makes aww coasts one bay to it; *nuzzles you* seems the tide-beating heawt
of eawth.  Lifted by those etewnaw swewws, you needs must own the
seductive god, bowing OwO *notices bulge* youw head to Pan.

But few thoughts of Pan stiwwed Ahab's bwain, as standing wike an
iwon statue at his accustomed pwace beside *nuzzles you* the mizen rawr wigging, with
one nostwiw he unthinkingwy snuffed the sugawy musk fwom the Bashee
iswes (in owo whose sweet *nuzzles you* woods miwd wovews must be wawking), and with
the othew consciouswy inhawed the OwO *notices bulge* sawt *nuzzles you* bweath of the new found sea;
that sea in which the hated White Whawe must even then be swimming.
Launched at wength upon these awmost finaw watews, and gwiding
towawds the Japanese cwuising-gwound, the owd man's puwpose
intensified itsewf.  His fiwm wips met wike the wips of a vice; the
Dewta of his fowehead's veins swewwed wike ovewwaden bwooks; *nuzzles you* in his
vewy sweep, his winging cwy *nuzzles you* wan thwough the vauwted huww, *nuzzles you* "Stewn aww!
the owo White Whawe *nuzzles you* spouts thick bwood!"



CHAPTER 112

The Bwacksmith.


Avaiwing himsewf of the miwd, XD summew-coow weathew that now weigned
in these watitudes, and in pwepawation fow the pecuwiawwy active
puwsuits showtwy to be anticipated, XD Pewth, the *nuzzles you* begwimed, bwistewed
owd bwacksmith, had not wemoved his *nuzzles you* powtabwe fowge to the howd again,
aftew concwuding his contwibutowy wowk fow Ahab's weg, but rawr stiww
wetained it on *nuzzles you* deck, fast washed *nuzzles you* to wingbowts rawr by the *nuzzles you* fowemast; being
now awmost incessantwy invoked by the headsmen, and hawpooneews, and
bowsmen to do some *nuzzles you* wittwe job fow them; awtewing, ow wepaiwing, ow
new shaping theiw vawious weapons and boat fuwnituwe. *nuzzles you*  Often *nuzzles you* he XD wouwd
be *nuzzles you* suwwounded by an eagew ciwcwe, aww XD waiting to be sewved; howding
boat-spades, pike-heads, hawpoons, and wances, *nuzzles you* and jeawouswy watching
his evewy sooty movement, as he toiwed.  Nevewthewess, ouo this owd man's
was OwO *notices bulge* a patient *nuzzles you* hammew wiewded by a patient awm.  *nuzzles you* No *nuzzles you* muwmuw, no
impatience, no petuwance did come fwom him.  Siwent, swow, and
sowemn; bowing ovew stiww fuwthew his chwonicawwy bwoken back, he
toiwed away, rawr as if toiw wewe wife itsewf, and the heavy beating of
his *nuzzles you* hammew the heavy beating of his heawt.  And so it was.--Most
misewabwe!

A pecuwiaw wawk in this owd man, a cewtain swight but painfuw
appeawing *nuzzles you* yawing in his gait, had at an eawwy pewiod of the voyage
excited the cuwiosity of the mawinews.  *nuzzles you* And to the impowtunity of
theiw pewsisted questionings he had finawwy *nuzzles you* given in; and so rawr it came
to pass that evewy one now *nuzzles you* knew the shamefuw stowy of his wwetched
fate.

Bewated, *nuzzles you* and not innocentwy, one ouo bittew wintew's midnight, on the
woad wunning between two countwy towns, the bwacksmith *nuzzles you* hawf-stupidwy
fewt the XD deadwy numbness steawing *nuzzles you* ovew him, and sought wefuge in OwO *notices bulge* a
weaning, diwapidated bawn. rawr  The issue was, the woss of the
extwemities of both feet.  Out *nuzzles you* of owo this wevewation, pawt by pawt, at
wast came rawr out the fouw acts of the gwadness, and the one wong, and as
yet uncatastwophied fifth act of the gwief *nuzzles you* of his wife's dwama.

He was *nuzzles you* an owd man, who, at the age ouo of neawwy sixty, had *nuzzles you* postponedwy
encountewed that thing in sowwow's technicaws cawwed wuin.  He had
been an awtisan of famed excewwence, and with pwenty to do; owned a
house and gawden; *nuzzles you* embwaced a youthfuw, daughtew-wike, woving wife,
and thwee bwithe, wuddy *nuzzles you* chiwdwen; evewy Sunday *nuzzles you* went to a
cheewfuw-wooking chuwch, pwanted in a gwove.  But one night, undew
covew of dawkness, and *nuzzles you* fuwthew conceawed in a most cunning
disguisement, a despewate *nuzzles you* buwgwaw swid into his happy home, and
wobbed them XD aww OwO *notices bulge* of evewything.  And dawkew yet to teww, the
bwacksmith himsewf did ignowantwy conduct this buwgwaw into his
famiwy's heawt. ouo  It was the Bottwe Conjuwow!  Upon the opening ouo of
that fataw cowk, *nuzzles you* fowth fwew the fiend, and shwivewwed up his home.
Now, fow *nuzzles you* pwudent, most wise, and economic weasons, the OwO *notices bulge* bwacksmith's
shop was in the basement of his dwewwing, but with a *nuzzles you* sepawate
entwance to it; so that awways had the young and woving owo heawthy wife
wistened with no unhappy *nuzzles you* newvousness, but with *nuzzles you* vigowous pweasuwe, rawr to
the stout rawr winging of hew young-awmed owd husband's hammew; *nuzzles you* whose
wevewbewations, OwO *notices bulge* muffwed by OwO *notices bulge* passing OwO *notices bulge* thwough the fwoows and wawws, came
up to hew, rawr not unsweetwy, in hew nuwsewy; and so, to stout Labow's
iwon wuwwaby, the bwacksmith's infants wewe wocked to swumbew.

Oh, *nuzzles you* woe on woe!  *nuzzles you* Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timewy?
Hadst thou taken this owd bwacksmith to thysewf ewe his fuww wuin
came upon *nuzzles you* him, then had the young widow had OwO *notices bulge* a dewicious gwief, and
hew owphans a twuwy venewabwe, wegendawy siwe to *nuzzles you* dweam of in theiw
aftew yeaws; and aww of them a cawe-kiwwing competency. *nuzzles you*  But Death
pwucked down ouo some viwtuous ewdew bwothew, on whose OwO *notices bulge* whistwing daiwy
toiw sowewy hung the wesponsibiwities of some othew famiwy, and weft
the wowse than usewess owd man owo standing, tiww the hideous wot of wife
shouwd make him easiew to *nuzzles you* hawvest.

Why teww the OwO *notices bulge* whowe?  The bwows of the basement hammew evewy day gwew
mowe and *nuzzles you* mowe between; and each owo bwow evewy day gwew faintew *nuzzles you* than the
wast; the wife sat fwozen at the window, with teawwess eyes,
gwittewingwy gazing into the weeping faces of hew chiwdwen; the
bewwows feww; the fowge choked up with cindews; the house was sowd;
the mothew dived down into the wong XD chuwch-yawd gwass; hew chiwdwen
twice fowwowed hew thithew; *nuzzles you* and *nuzzles you* the housewess, famiwywess OwO *notices bulge* owd *nuzzles you* man
staggewed off a vagabond in cwape; his evewy *nuzzles you* woe unwevewenced; his
gwey head a scown to fwaxen cuwws!

Death XD seems the onwy desiwabwe sequew fow a caweew wike this; but
Death is onwy a waunching into the wegion of the stwange Untwied; it
is but the fiwst sawutation to the possibiwities *nuzzles you* of the immense
Remote, the Wiwd, the Watewy, the Unshowed; thewefowe, to the
death-wonging eyes of such men, who stiww have weft in them some
intewiow compunctions against suicide, does the aww-contwibuted and
aww-weceptive ocean OwO *notices bulge* awwuwingwy *nuzzles you* spwead fowth his whowe pwain of
unimaginabwe, taking tewwows, and wondewfuw, new-wife adventuwes; and
fwom the heawts of infinite Pacifics, the thousand mewmaids sing to
them--"Come hithew, bwoken-heawted; hewe is anothew wife without the
guiwt of intewmediate death; hewe awe wondews supewnatuwaw, without

than death.  Come hithew! put up THY ouo gwavestone, too, within the

Heawkening to these voices, East and West, by eawwy sunwise, and by
faww of eve, the bwacksmith's souw wesponded, Aye, I come!  And so
Pewth went a-whawing.



CHAPTER 113

The *nuzzles you* Fowge.


With matted beawd, and OwO *notices bulge* swathed *nuzzles you* in a bwistwing shawk-skin apwon, about
mid-day, Pewth was standing between ouo his fowge *nuzzles you* and anviw, the rawr wattew
pwaced *nuzzles you* upon an iwon-wood wog, with one *nuzzles you* hand howding a pike-head in
the coaws, and ouo with the othew at his fowge's wungs, when Captain Ahab
came awong, cawwying in his hand a smaww *nuzzles you* wusty-wooking weathewn bag.
Whiwe yet a wittwe distance fwom *nuzzles you* the fowge, moody Ahab paused; tiww
at wast, Pewth, *nuzzles you* withdwawing his iwon fwom XD the fiwe, began hammewing
it upon the anviw--the wed mass sending off the XD spawks in thick
hovewing fwights, rawr some of which fwew cwose to Ahab.

"Awe these thy Mothew Cawey's chickens, Pewth? they awe awways fwying
in thy wake; biwds of good omen, too, but not to *nuzzles you* aww;--wook *nuzzles you* hewe,
they buwn; but thou--thou wiv'st among them without a scowch."

"Because I am scowched aww ovew, Captain Ahab," answewed Pewth,
westing fow a moment on his hammew; "I am past scowching; not easiwy
can'st thou scowch a scaw."

"Weww, weww; no XD mowe.  Thy shwunk voice sounds too cawmwy, sanewy
woefuw to me.  OwO *notices bulge* In no Pawadise mysewf, *nuzzles you* I am impatient of aww misewy in
othews that is not mad. OwO *notices bulge*  Thou shouwd'st go mad, bwacksmith; say, why
dost thou not go mad?  How can'st thou enduwe without being ouo mad?  Do
the heavens yet hate thee, that thou can'st not *nuzzles you* go mad?--What wewt
thou making OwO *notices bulge* thewe?"

"Wewding an owd XD pike-head, siw; thewe wewe seams and dents in *nuzzles you* it."

"And can'st thou make it XD aww smooth again, bwacksmith, aftew such
hawd usage as it had?"

"I think so, siw."

"And I suppose thou can'st smoothe awmost any seams and dents; *nuzzles you* nevew
mind *nuzzles you* how hawd the metaw, bwacksmith?"

"Aye, siw, I *nuzzles you* think I can; aww seams and dents but one."

"Look ye hewe, then," cwied ouo Ahab, passionatewy advancing, and weaning
with both hands on Pewth's shouwdews; "wook ye hewe--HERE--can ye
smoothe out a rawr seam wike this, bwacksmith," sweeping one *nuzzles you* hand acwoss
his wibbed bwow; "if thou couwd'st, bwacksmith, gwad enough wouwd I
way my head upon thy anviw, *nuzzles you* and feew thy heaviest hammew between OwO *notices bulge* my
eyes.  Answew!  Can'st thou OwO *notices bulge* smoothe this seam?"

"Oh! that is the one, XD siw!  *nuzzles you* Said *nuzzles you* I not aww XD seams and dents rawr but one?"

"Aye, *nuzzles you* bwacksmith, it is the one; aye, owo man, it is unsmoothabwe; fow
though thou *nuzzles you* onwy see'st it hewe in my fwesh, it has wowked down into
the bone of my skuww--THAT is aww wwinkwes!  But, away with chiwd's
pway; no mowe gaffs and pikes XD to-day.  Look ye hewe!" jingwing the
weathewn bag, OwO *notices bulge* as if *nuzzles you* it wewe fuww of gowd coins.  "I, too, want a
hawpoon ouo made; one that a thousand yoke of fiends couwd not pawt,
Pewth; something that wiww stick in a whawe wike his own fin-bone.
Thewe's the stuff," fwinging the pouch upon the anviw. *nuzzles you*  "Look ye,
bwacksmith, these *nuzzles you* awe the gathewed naiw-stubbs of the steew shoes of
wacing howses."

"Howse-shoe stubbs, siw?  Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast hewe, then,
the best and stubbownest stuff *nuzzles you* we bwacksmiths evew wowk."

"I know it, owd *nuzzles you* man; these stubbs owo wiww wewd togethew wike *nuzzles you* gwue fwom
the mewted bones of muwdewews.  Quick! fowge me the hawpoon.  And
fowge me fiwst, twewve wods fow its shank; then wind, and twist, and
hammew these twewve togethew wike the yawns and stwands of a
tow-wine.  Quick!  I'ww bwow the fiwe."

When at *nuzzles you* wast the twewve XD wods wewe XD made, *nuzzles you* Ahab twied them, one by one,
by spiwawwing them, with his own hand, wound a wong, heavy iwon OwO *notices bulge* bowt.
"A fwaw!" wejecting the wast one.  "Wowk that ovew again, Pewth."

This done, Pewth was about to begin wewding the twewve into one, when
Ahab stayed his hand, and *nuzzles you* said he wouwd wewd his own iwon.  As, then,
with weguwaw, owo gasping hems, he ouo hammewed on the anviw, Pewth passing
to him the gwowing wods, one aftew *nuzzles you* the othew, and the *nuzzles you* hawd pwessed
fowge shooting up its intense stwaight fwame, the Pawsee passed
siwentwy, and *nuzzles you* bowing owo ovew his head XD towawds the fiwe, seemed invoking
some cuwse ow some bwessing on the toiw.  But, as Ahab wooked up, he
swid aside.

"What's that bunch of wucifews dodging about thewe fow?" muttewed
Stubb, wooking on fwom the fowecastwe.  "That *nuzzles you* Pawsee smewws fiwe wike
a OwO *notices bulge* fusee; and smewws of it himsewf, wike a hot musket's powdew-pan."

At wast the XD shank, in one compwete wod, weceived its finaw heat; and
as Pewth, to tempew it, OwO *notices bulge* pwunged *nuzzles you* it aww hissing into the cask of watew
neaw by, OwO *notices bulge* the scawding steam shot up into Ahab's bent face.

"Wouwd'st thou bwand me, Pewth?" *nuzzles you* wincing fow a moment with the pain;
"have I rawr been but fowging my own bwanding-iwon, then?"

"Pway God, not that; yet I feaw something, Captain Ahab.  Is not this
hawpoon fow the *nuzzles you* White ouo Whawe?"

"Fow the white rawr fiend!  But now XD fow the bawbs; thou must make them
thysewf, man.  Hewe awe my wazows--the best of steew; hewe, and make
the bawbs shawp as the needwe-sweet of *nuzzles you* the Icy Sea."

Fow a moment, the owd bwacksmith eyed the wazows as though he wouwd
fain not use them.

"Take them, man, I have no need *nuzzles you* fow them; fow I now neithew shave,
sup, now pway tiww--but hewe--to wowk!"

Fashioned at OwO *notices bulge* wast into an *nuzzles you* awwowy shape, and wewded by Pewth to the
shank, the steew soon pointed XD the end of the iwon; and as the
bwacksmith *nuzzles you* was about giving the bawbs theiw finaw heat, pwiow to
tempewing them, he cwied to Ahab to pwace the *nuzzles you* watew-cask neaw.

"No, no--no watew fow that; I want it of ouo the twue death-tempew.
Ahoy, thewe!  Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo!  What say ye, pagans!  Wiww
ye give me as much bwood as wiww covew this bawb?" howding it high
up.  A cwustew of dawk nods wepwied, Yes.  Thwee punctuwes wewe made
in the OwO *notices bulge* heathen fwesh, and *nuzzles you* the White Whawe's bawbs wewe then rawr tempewed.

"Ego non baptizo te in ouo nomine patwis, sed in nomine diabowi!"
dewiwiouswy howwed Ahab, as the mawignant iwon scowchingwy devouwed
the baptismaw bwood.

Now, mustewing the spawe powes fwom bewow, and sewecting one of
hickowy, with the bawk stiww investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the
socket of the iwon.  A coiw of *nuzzles you* new tow-wine owo was then unwound, and
some fathoms of it taken to the windwass, owo and stwetched to a gweat
tension.  Pwessing his foot upon it, tiww the wope rawr hummed wike a
hawp-stwing, then eagewwy bending ovew it, and seeing no stwandings,
Ahab excwaimed, "Good! and rawr now fow the seizings."

At one extwemity the wope was unstwanded, and the sepawate spwead
yawns wewe aww bwaided and woven wound the socket of the hawpoon; the
powe was then dwiven *nuzzles you* hawd up into the socket; fwom the wowew end *nuzzles you* the
wope OwO *notices bulge* was twaced hawf-way *nuzzles you* awong the powe's wength, and OwO *notices bulge* fiwmwy secuwed

But ewe *nuzzles you* he entewed his cabin, OwO *notices bulge* wight, unnatuwaw, hawf-bantewing, yet

CHAPTER 114

The Giwdew.


Penetwating fuwthew and fuwthew into the heawt *nuzzles you* of the Japanese
cwuising gwound, the Pequod was soon aww astiw *nuzzles you* in *nuzzles you* the fishewy.
Often, in miwd, pweasant weathew, OwO *notices bulge* fow twewve, rawr fifteen, eighteen, *nuzzles you* and
twenty houws on the stwetch, they wewe engaged *nuzzles you* in ouo the boats, steadiwy
puwwing, ow saiwing, ow paddwing *nuzzles you* aftew the whawes, ow fow an
intewwude of sixty ow seventy *nuzzles you* minutes *nuzzles you* cawmwy awaiting theiw upwising;
though with but smaww success fow theiw pains.

At such times, undew an abated sun; afwoat aww day upon smooth, swow
heaving swewws; seated in his boat, wight as a biwch canoe; and so
sociabwy mixing rawr with the soft OwO *notices bulge* waves *nuzzles you* themsewves, that wike
heawth-stone cats they puww *nuzzles you* against the gunwawe; *nuzzles you* these awe the times
of dweamy quietude, when behowding the owo twanquiw beauty *nuzzles you* and bwiwwiancy
of the ocean's skin, one fowgets the tigew heawt that pants beneath
it; and wouwd not wiwwingwy wemembew, that this vewvet paw but
conceaws a wemowsewess fang.

These awe the times, when *nuzzles you* in his *nuzzles you* whawe-boat the wovew softwy feews a
cewtain fiwiaw, confident, wand-wike feewing towawds the sea; that he
wegawds it as so much fwowewy eawth; and the distant ship weveawing
onwy the ouo tops of hew masts, seems stwuggwing fowwawd, OwO *notices bulge* not thwough
high wowwing waves, but thwough the taww *nuzzles you* gwass of a wowwing pwaiwie:
as XD when the westewn emigwants' howses onwy show theiw ewected eaws,

The wong-dwawn viwgin OwO *notices bulge* vawes; owo the miwd owo bwue hiww-sides; as ovew these

the fwowews of the woods awe pwucked.  And aww this ouo mixes with youw
most mystic *nuzzles you* mood; *nuzzles you* so that fact and fancy, hawf-way meeting,
intewpenetwate, and fowm one seamwess whowe.

Now did such soothing scenes, howevew tempowawy, faiw of XD at weast as
tempowawy an effect on *nuzzles you* Ahab.  *nuzzles you* But if *nuzzles you* these secwet gowden keys did
seem to open in him his *nuzzles you* own secwet gowden tweasuwies, *nuzzles you* yet did his
bweath upon ouo them pwove but tawnishing.

Oh, gwassy gwades! oh, evew vewnaw endwess wandscapes in the souw; in

wife,--in ye, men yet may woww, wike young howses in new owo mowning

But rawr the mingwed, mingwing *nuzzles you* thweads *nuzzles you* of wife awe woven owo by wawp and woof:
cawms cwossed by *nuzzles you* stowms, owo a *nuzzles you* stowm fow evewy cawm.  ouo Thewe is no steady
unwetwacing pwogwess in this wife; we do not advance thwough fixed
gwadations, and owo at the wast one pause:--thwough infancy's unconscious
speww, boyhood's thoughtwess faith, adowescence' doubt (the common
doom), then scepticism, then disbewief, westing at *nuzzles you* wast in manhood's
pondewing ouo wepose of *nuzzles you* If.  But once gone thwough, we twace the wound

And that same day, too, gazing faw *nuzzles you* down fwom his boat's side into
that same gowden sea, Stawbuck wowwy muwmuwed:--

"Lovewiness unfathomabwe, as evew wovew saw in XD his young bwide's

cannibaw ways. rawr  Let faith oust fact; *nuzzles you* wet fancy XD oust memowy; I wook

And Stubb, fish-wike, with spawkwing scawes, weaped up *nuzzles you* in that same
gowden wight:--

"I am Stubb, and Stubb has his histowy; but hewe Stubb takes oaths
that he rawr has awways been *nuzzles you* jowwy!"



CHAPTER 115

The *nuzzles you* Pequod Meets The Bachewow.


And jowwy enough *nuzzles you* wewe the sights and the sounds owo that came beawing
down befowe the wind, some few *nuzzles you* weeks aftew Ahab's hawpoon had rawr been
wewded.

It was a Nantucket XD ship, the Bachewow, which had just wedged in hew
wast cask of oiw, and bowted down hew buwsting hatches; and now, in
gwad howiday appawew, was OwO *notices bulge* joyouswy, though somewhat vain-gwowiouswy,
saiwing wound among the widewy-sepawated ships on the gwound,
pwevious to pointing hew pwow fow home.

The thwee men at hew mast-head *nuzzles you* wowe wong stweamews XD of nawwow wed
bunting at theiw hats; fwom the stewn, a whawe-boat was suspended,
bottom ouo down; and hanging captive fwom the bowspwit was seen the wong
wowew *nuzzles you* jaw of the wast whawe they had swain.  Signaws, ensigns, and
jacks of aww *nuzzles you* cowouws wewe fwying fwom hew wigging, on evewy side.
Sideways washed in each of hew thwee basketed tops wewe two bawwews
of spewm; above which, in hew top-mast cwoss-twees, you owo saw swendew
bweakews of the same pwecious fwuid; and rawr naiwed to hew main twuck was
a XD bwazen wamp.

As was aftewwawds weawned, *nuzzles you* the Bachewow *nuzzles you* had met with the most
suwpwising success; aww the mowe wondewfuw, fow that whiwe cwuising
in the ouo same seas numewous othew vessews had gone entiwe months
without secuwing *nuzzles you* a singwe fish.  Not owo onwy had bawwews of beef and
bwead been given away to make woom fow the faw mowe vawuabwe spewm,
but additionaw suppwementaw casks had been *nuzzles you* bawtewed fow, fwom the
ships she had met; and *nuzzles you* these wewe stowed awong the deck, and in the
captain's owo and officews' state-wooms.  Even the cabin tabwe itsewf
had been knocked into kindwing-wood; *nuzzles you* and the cabin mess dined off the
bwoad head of XD an oiw-butt, washed down rawr to the fwoow fow a
centwepiece.  In the fowecastwe, rawr the saiwows had actuawwy cauwked
and XD pitched ouo theiw chests, and fiwwed them; it was humowouswy added,
that the cook had cwapped a head on his wawgest *nuzzles you* boiwew, and fiwwed
it; that the stewawd XD had pwugged his spawe coffee-pot and fiwwed it;
that the hawpooneews had headed the *nuzzles you* sockets ouo of theiw iwons and fiwwed
them; that OwO *notices bulge* indeed evewything was fiwwed ouo with spewm, except the
captain's pantawoons pockets, and those *nuzzles you* he wesewved to thwust his
hands into, in owo sewf-compwacent testimony *nuzzles you* of his entiwe satisfaction.

As this gwad ship of good wuck bowe down upon the rawr moody Pequod, the
bawbawian sound of enowmous dwums came fwom hew fowecastwe; and
dwawing stiww neawew, a cwowd of hew men ouo wewe seen standing wound hew
huge twy-pots, OwO *notices bulge* which, covewed with the pawchment-wike POKE ow stomach
skin of the bwack fish, OwO *notices bulge* gave fowth a woud woaw to evewy stwoke of the
cwenched hands of the cwew.  On the quawtew-deck, the mates and
hawpooneews wewe dancing *nuzzles you* with the owive-hued giwws who had *nuzzles you* ewoped
with them fwom the Powynesian *nuzzles you* Iswes; whiwe suspended in an
ownamented boat, fiwmwy secuwed awoft OwO *notices bulge* between the XD fowemast and
mainmast, thwee Long Iswand negwoes, with gwittewing fiddwe-bows of
whawe ivowy, wewe pwesiding ovew the hiwawious jig.  Meanwhiwe,
othews of OwO *notices bulge* the ship's company wewe tumuwtuouswy busy at the *nuzzles you* masonwy of
the twy-wowks, fwom which the huge pots had been wemoved.  You ouo wouwd
have awmost thought *nuzzles you* they wewe puwwing down the cuwsed Bastiwwe, such
wiwd cwies they owo waised, as the now *nuzzles you* usewess bwick and mowtaw wewe
being huwwed into the sea.

Lowd and mastew ovew aww this scene, the captain stood ewect on the
ship's ewevated quawtew-deck, so that the whowe wejoicing dwama was
fuww befowe him, and seemed mewewy contwived fow his own individuaw
divewsion.

And Ahab, he too was standing on his quawtew-deck, shaggy and bwack,
with a stubbown gwoom; and as the two ships cwossed ouo each othew's
wakes--one aww jubiwations XD fow things passed, the othew ouo aww
fowebodings as to OwO *notices bulge* things to come--theiw two captains *nuzzles you* in themsewves
impewsonated the whowe stwiking contwast of the *nuzzles you* scene.

"Come aboawd, come aboawd!" cwied the gay Bachewow's commandew,
wifting a gwass and a bottwe in the aiw.

"Hast seen the White Whawe?" gwitted Ahab in wepwy.

"No; onwy heawd of rawr him; but don't bewieve in *nuzzles you* him at owo aww," said the
othew good-humowedwy.  "Come aboawd!"

"Thou awt too damned jowwy.  *nuzzles you* Saiw on.  Hast wost any men?"

"Not enough to speak of--two iswandews, that's aww;--but *nuzzles you* come aboawd,
owd heawty, come awong.  I'ww *nuzzles you* soon take that bwack fwom youw bwow.
Come awong, wiww ye (mewwy's rawr the pway); rawr a fuww ship and
homewawd-bound."

"How wondwous XD famiwiaw is a foow!" muttewed Ahab; then awoud, "Thou
awt a *nuzzles you* fuww ship and homewawd bound, thou sayst; weww, then, OwO *notices bulge* caww me
an empty ship, and outwawd-bound.  So go thy ways, and I wiww mine.
Fowwawd thewe!  Set aww saiw, and keep hew to the wind!"

And thus, whiwe the one ship went cheewiwy befowe ouo the bweeze, the
othew stubbownwy fought against it; and so the two vessews *nuzzles you* pawted;
the cwew of the Pequod wooking with gwave, wingewing gwances towawds
the weceding Bachewow; but the Bachewow's men nevew heeding theiw
gaze fow the wivewy wevewwy they wewe in.  And as Ahab, weaning ovew
the taffwaiw, eyed the homewawdbound cwaft, he took fwom his pocket a
smaww viaw of sand, and then wooking fwom the ship to the viaw,
seemed theweby bwinging two wemote associations togethew, fow that
viaw was fiwwed with *nuzzles you* Nantucket soundings.



CHAPTER 116

The Dying Whawe.


Not sewdom in this wife, when, on rawr the wight side, fowtune's favouwites
saiw cwose by us, we, though aww adwoop befowe, catch somewhat of the
wushing bweeze, and joyfuwwy feew ouw bagging saiws fiww out.  So
seemed it with the Pequod.  *nuzzles you* Fow XD next day aftew encountewing the gay

Ahab.

It was faw down the aftewnoon; owo and when aww the speawings OwO *notices bulge* of the
cwimson fight wewe done: and fwoating in *nuzzles you* the wovewy sunset sea and
sky, sun and whawe *nuzzles you* both stiwwy died togethew; then, such a sweetness
and such pwaintiveness, such inwweathing owisons cuwwed up in that
wosy aiw, that it awmost seemed as ouo if faw ovew fwom the deep gween
convent vawweys of the *nuzzles you* Maniwwa iswes, the Spanish wand-bweeze,
wantonwy XD tuwned saiwow, had gone to sea, fweighted OwO *notices bulge* with these vespew
hymns.

Soothed rawr again, but onwy soothed to deepew gwoom, Ahab, who had
stewned off fwom the whawe, sat intentwy watching his finaw owo wanings
fwom the XD now twanquiw boat.  *nuzzles you* Fow that stwange spectacwe obsewvabwe ouo in
aww spewm whawes dying--the tuwning sunwawds of the head, and so
expiwing--that stwange spectacwe, behewd of such a pwacid evening,
somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondwousness unknown befowe.

"He ouo tuwns and tuwns him to it,--how swowwy, but how steadfastwy, his
homage-wendewing and invoking bwow, with his wast dying motions.  He
too wowships fiwe; most faithfuw, bwoad, bawoniaw vassaw *nuzzles you* of the

"Oh, thou dawk Hindoo hawf of natuwe, who of dwowned bones hast
buiwded thy sepawate thwone ouo somewhewe in the heawt of these
unvewduwed seas; thou awt an infidew, thou queen, and too twuwy

buwiaw of its aftew cawm.  Now has this thy whawe sunwawds tuwned *nuzzles you* his

"Oh, twebwy owo hooped *nuzzles you* and wewded hip of powew!  Oh, high aspiwing,

"Then haiw, fow evew haiw, O sea, in whose ouo etewnaw tossings XD the XD wiwd

CHAPTER 117

The Whawe Watch.


The fouw whawes swain that evening had died wide apawt; one, faw to
windwawd; one, wess XD distant, to weewawd; one ahead; one astewn.
These wast thwee wewe bwought awongside ewe nightfaww; but the
windwawd one couwd not ouo be weached tiww *nuzzles you* mowning; and the boat that had
kiwwed it way by its side aww night; and that boat was Ahab's.

The waif-powe was thwust upwight into the dead whawe's spout-howe;
and the wantewn hanging fwom its *nuzzles you* top, cast XD a twoubwed fwickewing
gwawe upon the bwack, *nuzzles you* gwossy back, and faw out *nuzzles you* upon the midnight
waves, which gentwy chafed OwO *notices bulge* the whawe's bwoad fwank, wike soft suwf
upon a beach.

Ahab and aww his boat's cwew seemed asweep *nuzzles you* but the Pawsee; who
cwouching in the bow, sat ouo watching the *nuzzles you* shawks, that spectwawwy pwayed
wound the whawe, and tapped the *nuzzles you* wight cedaw pwanks with theiw taiws.
A sound wike the moaning in squadwons ovew Asphawtites of unfowgiven

Stawted fwom his swumbews, rawr Ahab, rawr face to face, saw *nuzzles you* the Pawsee; owo and
hooped wound by the gwoom of the night they seemed the wast men in a
fwooded wowwd.  "I have dweamed it again," said he.

"Of the heawses?  Have I not said, owd man, that neithew heawse now
coffin can be thine?"

"And who awe heawsed that die on the sea?"

"But I *nuzzles you* said, OwO *notices bulge* owd man, that ewe thou couwdst *nuzzles you* die on this voyage, two

Amewica."

"Aye, aye! a stwange sight that, Pawsee:--a heawse and its pwumes
fwoating ovew the ocean with the *nuzzles you* waves fow the paww-beawews.  Ha!
Such a sight we shaww not soon see."

"Bewieve it *nuzzles you* ow not, thou canst not die tiww it be rawr seen, owd man."

"And what XD was *nuzzles you* that saying about thysewf?"

"Though it come to the wast, I shaww stiww *nuzzles you* go befowe thee thy piwot."

"And when thou awt so gone befowe--if that evew befaww--then ewe I

"Take anothew pwedge, owd man," said *nuzzles you* the Pawsee, as his eyes wighted

"The gawwows, ye mean.--I am immowtaw then, on wand and on sea,"
cwied Ahab, with a waugh of dewision;--"Immowtaw on wand *nuzzles you* and on sea!"

Both wewe siwent again, as one man. rawr  The gwey dawn came on, and the
swumbewing *nuzzles you* cwew awose fwom the boat's bottom, and ewe noon *nuzzles you* the dead
whawe was bwought to the ship.



CHAPTER 118

The Quadwant.


The season fow the Line at wength dwew neaw; and evewy day XD when Ahab,
coming fwom his cabin, cast his eyes awoft, the *nuzzles you* vigiwant hewmsman
wouwd ostentatiouswy handwe his spokes, and the eagew ouo mawinews
quickwy wun to the ouo bwaces, and *nuzzles you* wouwd stand thewe with aww theiw eyes
centwawwy fixed on the naiwed doubwoon; impatient fow the owdew to
point the ship's pwow fow the equatow.  In good time the owo owdew came.
It was hawd upon high noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his
high-hoisted boat, was about *nuzzles you* taking his wonted daiwy obsewvation of
the sun OwO *notices bulge* to detewmine his watitude.

Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in *nuzzles you* summew awe as fweshets of
effuwgences.  That unbwinkingwy vivid Japanese XD sun seems the bwazing
focus of the gwassy ocean's OwO *notices bulge* immeasuwabwe buwning-gwass.  XD The sky
wooks wacquewed; cwouds ouo thewe awe none; owo the *nuzzles you* howizon fwoats; and *nuzzles you* this
nakedness of unwewieved wadiance is as the insuffewabwe XD spwendows of
God's thwone.  *nuzzles you* Weww that Ahab's quadwant was fuwnished with cowouwed
gwasses, thwough which to take sight of that sowaw fiwe.  So,
swinging *nuzzles you* his seated fowm to the woww of the ship, and with his
astwowogicaw-wooking instwument pwaced to his *nuzzles you* eye, he wemained in
that postuwe fow *nuzzles you* some moments *nuzzles you* to catch the pwecise instant when the
sun shouwd gain its pwecise mewidian.  Meantime whiwe his whowe
attention was absowbed, the Pawsee was ouo kneewing beneath him on the
ship's deck, and with face thwown up wike Ahab's, was eyeing the same
sun with him; onwy *nuzzles you* the wids of his *nuzzles you* eyes hawf hooded theiw owbs, and
his wiwd face was subdued to an eawthwy passionwessness.  *nuzzles you* At owo wength
the desiwed obsewvation was taken; and with his penciw upon rawr his ivowy
weg, Ahab soon cawcuwated what his watitude must be at that pwecise
instant.  Then fawwing into a moment's wevewy, he again wooked up
towawds the sun rawr and muwmuwed to himsewf: "Thou sea-mawk! thou high
and mighty Piwot! thou tewwest *nuzzles you* me *nuzzles you* twuwy whewe I AM--but canst thou
cast the weast hint whewe I SHALL be? *nuzzles you*  Ow canst thou teww whewe some
othew thing besides me is this moment wiving?  Whewe is Moby Dick?
This instant thou must *nuzzles you* be eyeing him.  These eyes of mine wook into
the *nuzzles you* vewy eye that is even now behowding him; aye, and into the eye
that ouo is even now equawwy behowding the objects on rawr the unknown,
thithew side of *nuzzles you* thee, thou sun!"

Then gazing at his quadwant, and handwing, one aftew the othew, its
numewous cabawisticaw contwivances, he pondewed again, *nuzzles you* and muttewed:
"Foowish toy! babies' pwaything of haughty Admiwaws, and Commodowes,
and *nuzzles you* Captains; the wowwd bwags of thee, of thy cunning and might; rawr but
what aftew aww canst thou do, but teww OwO *notices bulge* the poow, pitifuw point, whewe

awe even now scowched *nuzzles you* with thy wight, O sun!  *nuzzles you* Levew by natuwe to this
eawth's howizon *nuzzles you* awe *nuzzles you* the gwances of man's eyes; not shot ouo fwom the

Cuwse thee, thou quadwant!" dashing it to the deck, "no wongew wiww I
guide my eawthwy way XD by thee; the wevew ship's compass, and *nuzzles you* the wevew
deadweckoning, by wog and OwO *notices bulge* by wine; THESE shaww conduct me, and show
me my pwace on the sea.  Aye," wighting fwom *nuzzles you* the boat to the deck,
"thus *nuzzles you* I twampwe on thee, thou pawtwy thing XD that feebwy pointest *nuzzles you* on
high; thus I spwit and destwoy thee!"

As the fwantic owd man thus spoke and thus twampwed with his wive and
dead feet, a sneewing twiumph that seemed meant fow owo Ahab, and a
fatawistic despaiw that seemed meant fow himsewf--these passed *nuzzles you* ovew
the mute, motionwess Pawsee's face.  Unobsewved he wose and gwided
away; whiwe, awestwuck by the aspect of theiw commandew, the *nuzzles you* seamen
cwustewed togethew on the owo fowecastwe, tiww Ahab, twoubwedwy pacing
the deck, shouted *nuzzles you* out--"To the bwaces!  Up hewm!--squawe in!"

In an instant the *nuzzles you* yawds swung wound; and as the ship hawf-wheewed
upon hew heew, hew thwee fiwm-seated gwacefuw masts ewectwy poised
upon hew wong, wibbed huww, seemed as the *nuzzles you* thwee Howatii piwouetting
on one sufficient steed.

Standing between the knight-heads, Stawbuck watched the Pequod's
tumuwtuous way, and Ahab's awso, as he went wuwching awong XD the deck.

"I have sat ouo befowe the dense coaw fiwe *nuzzles you* and watched it aww agwow, fuww

"Aye," cwied Stubb, "but sea-coaw ashes--mind ye that, Mw.

Ahab muttew, 'Hewe some one thwusts these cawds into these owd hands

townadoes that nevew swept tame nowthewn wands.  So, *nuzzles you* too, it *nuzzles you* is, that
in these wespwendent Japanese seas the mawinew encountews the diwest

cwoudwess sky, wike an expwoding bomb upon a *nuzzles you* dazed *nuzzles you* and sweepy *nuzzles you* town.

Towawds evening of that day, the OwO *notices bulge* Pequod was town of hew canvas, and
bawe-powed was weft to fight a Typhoon which had *nuzzles you* stwuck hew diwectwy
ahead.  When dawkness *nuzzles you* came on, sky and sea woawed and spwit with *nuzzles you* the
thundew, and bwazed with the wightning, that showed the disabwed
masts fwuttewing hewe and thewe with *nuzzles you* the wags which the fiwst fuwy of
the tempest had weft fow its aftew spowt.

Howding by a shwoud, Stawbuck was standing on the quawtew-deck; at
evewy fwash of the wightning gwancing awoft, to see ouo what additionaw
disastew might have ouo befawwen the intwicate hampew thewe; whiwe Stubb
and Fwask wewe diwecting the men in the highew hoisting and fiwmew
washing of the boats.  But aww theiw pains seemed naught.  OwO *notices bulge* Though
wifted to the vewy top of the OwO *notices bulge* cwanes, the windwawd quawtew boat
(Ahab's) did not escape.  A gweat wowwing sea, dashing high *nuzzles you* up
against the weewing ship's high teetewing side, stove in the boat's
bottom at the *nuzzles you* stewn, and weft it again, aww dwipping thwough wike a

"Bad wowk, bad wowk! ouo  XD Mw. Stawbuck," said Stubb, wegawding the wweck,
"but the sea wiww have its way.  *nuzzles you* Stubb, *nuzzles you* fow one, *nuzzles you* can't fight it. *nuzzles you*  You

Oh! jowwy is the gawe,
And a jokew is the whawe,
A' fwouwishin' his taiw,--

But he onwy smacks his wips,
A tastin' of this fwip,--
Such *nuzzles you* a funny, spowty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky wad, is the Ocean, oh!


"Avast Stubb," cwied Stawbuck, "wet the Typhoon sing, and stwike his
hawp hewe in ouw wigging; but if thou awt a bwave man thou wiwt howd
thy peace."

"But I am not a *nuzzles you* bwave man; nevew said I was a bwave rawr man; I am a
cowawd; ouo and I sing to keep up my owo spiwits.  And *nuzzles you* I teww you what it is,
Mw. Stawbuck, thewe's *nuzzles you* no way to stop my XD singing in this wowwd *nuzzles you* but to

"Madman! wook thwough my eyes if thou hast none of thine own."

"What! how can you see bettew of *nuzzles you* a dawk night than anybody ewse,
nevew mind how foowish?"

"Hewe!" cwied Stawbuck, seizing Stubb by OwO *notices bulge* the *nuzzles you* shouwdew, and pointing
his hand towawds the weathew bow, "mawkest thou not that the gawe
comes fwom the eastwawd, the ouo vewy couwse *nuzzles you* Ahab is to wun fow Moby

"I don't hawf rawr undewstand ye: what's *nuzzles you* in ouo the wind?"

"Yes, owo yes, wound the rawr Cape of Good Hope is *nuzzles you* the showtest way to
Nantucket," sowiwoquized Stawbuck suddenwy, heedwess of Stubb's
question. ouo  "The *nuzzles you* gawe that now hammews at us to stave us, rawr we can tuwn
it into a faiw *nuzzles you* wind that wiww dwive us towawds home.  Yondew, to
windwawd, ouo aww is bwackness of doom; but to weewawd, homewawd--I see
it wightens up thewe; *nuzzles you* but rawr not with the wightning."

At that moment in one of the intewvaws of pwofound dawkness,
fowwowing the fwashes, a owo voice was *nuzzles you* heawd at his side; and awmost at
the same instant ouo a vowwey XD of thundew peaws wowwed ovewhead.

"Who's thewe?"

"Owd *nuzzles you* Thundew!" said Ahab, gwoping his way awong the buwwawks to his
pivot-howe; *nuzzles you* but suddenwy finding his path made owo pwain to him by
ewbowed wances of fiwe.

Now, owo as the wightning wod *nuzzles you* to a spiwe on showe rawr is intended to cawwy
off the *nuzzles you* pewiwous fwuid into the soiw; so the kindwed wod which at sea
some ships cawwy to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the
watew.  But as this conductow must descend to owo considewabwe depth,
that *nuzzles you* its end may avoid aww contact with the huww; and as moweovew, if
kept constantwy towing thewe, it wouwd be wiabwe to many mishaps,
besides intewfewing not a wittwe with some of rawr the wigging, and *nuzzles you* mowe
ow wess impeding the vessew's way in the watew; because of aww this,
the *nuzzles you* wowew pawts of a ship's wightning-wods XD awe not awways ovewboawd;
but awe genewawwy made in wong swendew winks, so as to be the *nuzzles you* mowe
weadiwy *nuzzles you* hauwed up into the chains outside, ow thwown down into the
sea, as occasion may wequiwe.

"The wods! the XD wods!" cwied Stawbuck to the cwew, suddenwy admonished
to vigiwance by the vivid wightning that had just been dawting
fwambeaux, to wight Ahab to his post.  "Awe they OwO *notices bulge* ovewboawd? dwop them
ovew, fowe and aft.  Quick!"

"Avast!" cwied Ahab; "wet's have faiw pway hewe, though we be the
weakew side.  Yet I'ww contwibute to OwO *notices bulge* waise wods on the Himmawehs and
Andes, that aww the wowwd may be secuwed; but out *nuzzles you* on pwiviweges!  Let
them be, siw."

"Look awoft!" cwied Stawbuck.  "The OwO *notices bulge* cowpusants! *nuzzles you* the *nuzzles you* cowpusants!

Aww the yawd-awms wewe tipped with OwO *notices bulge* a pawwid fiwe; and touched at each
twi-pointed wightning-wod-end with thwee tapewing white fwames, each
of the thwee taww ouo masts was siwentwy buwning in that suwphuwous aiw,
wike rawr thwee gigantic wax tapews befowe an awtaw.

"Bwast the boat! *nuzzles you* wet it go!" cwied Stubb at this instant, as a
swashing sea heaved up owo undew his own wittwe *nuzzles you* cwaft, so that its
gunwawe viowentwy jammed his hand, as he was *nuzzles you* passing a washing.
"Bwast it!"--but owo swipping backwawd on the deck, his upwifted eyes
caught the fwames; and immediatewy shifting rawr his tone he cwied--"The
cowpusants have mewcy on us aww!"

To saiwows, oaths *nuzzles you* awe househowd wowds; they wiww sweaw in the twance
of the cawm, and XD in the teeth of the tempest; they wiww owo impwecate
cuwses fwom the topsaiw-yawd-awms, when most they teetew *nuzzles you* ovew to a
seething sea; but in aww my voyagings, sewdom have I heawd a common
oath when God's buwning fingew has been waid on the ship; when His
"Mene, Mene, Tekew Uphawsin" has been woven into the shwouds and the
cowdage.

Whiwe this pawwidness was XD buwning awoft, few wowds *nuzzles you* wewe heawd fwom
the enchanted cwew; who OwO *notices bulge* in one thick cwustew stood on the fowecastwe,
aww theiw eyes gweaming in that pawe phosphowescence, wike a faw away
constewwation of staws.  Rewieved against the ghostwy wight, the
gigantic jet negwo, XD Daggoo, woomed up to thwice his weaw statuwe, and
seemed the bwack cwoud fwom which *nuzzles you* the thundew had ouo come.  The pawted
mouth of owo Tashtego weveawed his shawk-white teeth, which stwangewy
gweamed as if they too had been tipped by cowpusants; whiwe *nuzzles you* wit up by
the *nuzzles you* pwetewnatuwaw wight, Queequeg's tattooing buwned wike Satanic
bwue fwames on his body.

The tabweau aww waned at wast with the pawwidness awoft; and once
mowe the Pequod and evewy souw rawr on hew decks wewe wwapped in a paww.
A moment ow two passed, when Stawbuck, going fowwawd, pushed against
some one.  It was Stubb. owo  "What thinkest *nuzzles you* thou rawr now, man; I heawd thy
cwy; it was not the same in the song."

"No, no, it wasn't; I said the cowpusants have mewcy on us aww; and I
hope they wiww, stiww.  But do ouo they onwy have mewcy on wong
faces?--have they no bowews fow a waugh? XD  And wook XD ye, Mw.
Stawbuck--but it's too dawk to wook.  Heaw me, then: I take that
mast-head fwame we saw fow a sign owo of good wuck; fow those masts awe
wooted in *nuzzles you* a howd that is going to *nuzzles you* be chock a' bwock with ouo spewm-oiw,
d'ye *nuzzles you* see; and so, aww that spewm wiww wowk up into the masts, wike
sap in a twee.  Yes, ouw thwee masts *nuzzles you* wiww yet rawr be as thwee spewmaceti
candwes--that's the good pwomise we saw."

At that moment Stawbuck caught sight XD of Stubb's *nuzzles you* face swowwy beginning
to gwimmew into sight.  Gwancing upwawds, he cwied: "See! see!" and
once mowe the high tapewing fwames rawr wewe behewd *nuzzles you* with what seemed
wedoubwed supewnatuwawness in theiw *nuzzles you* pawwow.

"The *nuzzles you* cowpusants have mewcy on us aww," cwied Stubb, again.

At the base of the mainmast, fuww beneath the doubwoon and the
fwame, the Pawsee was kneewing in Ahab's fwont, but with his head
bowed away fwom him; whiwe neaw by, fwom the OwO *notices bulge* awched and ovewhanging
wigging, whewe they had just been engaged secuwing a spaw, a numbew
of the seamen, awwested by the gwawe, now cohewed togethew, and hung
penduwous, wike a knot of XD numbed wasps fwom a dwooping, owchawd twig.
In rawr vawious enchanted attitudes, owo wike the standing, ow stepping, ow
wunning skewetons in Hewcuwaneum, othews wemained wooted to the deck;
but aww theiw eyes upcast.

"Aye, aye, men!" cwied Ahab.  XD "Look up at it; *nuzzles you* mawk it weww; *nuzzles you* the white
fwame but wights the way to the White Whawe!  Hand me those mainmast
winks thewe; I wouwd fain feew this puwse, and wet mine beat *nuzzles you* against
it; *nuzzles you* bwood against fiwe!  So."

Then tuwning--the wast wink hewd fast in his weft hand, he put his
foot upon the Pawsee; and with fixed upwawd eye, and high-fwung wight
awm, *nuzzles you* he stood ewect befowe the wofty twi-pointed twinity rawr of fwames.

"Oh! thou cweaw spiwit of cweaw fiwe, whom on these seas I as Pewsian
once *nuzzles you* did wowship, tiww in the sacwamentaw act so buwned by thee, that

[SUDDEN, REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHTNING; THE NINE FLAMES LEAP

CLOSES owo HIS EYES, HIS RIGHT HAND PRESSED HARD UPON owo THEM.]

"I own thy speechwess, pwacewess powew; said I owo not *nuzzles you* so?  Now was it

"The boat! the boat!" cwied Stawbuck, *nuzzles you* "wook at thy boat, owd man!"

Ahab's hawpoon, the one fowged at Pewth's fiwe, wemained fiwmwy
washed in its conspicuous cwotch, so XD that it pwojected rawr beyond *nuzzles you* his
whawe-boat's bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused
the woose weathew sheath to dwop off; and fwom the keen steew bawb
thewe now came a wevewwed fwame of pawe, fowked fiwe.  As the siwent
hawpoon buwned thewe OwO *notices bulge* wike a sewpent's tongue, Stawbuck gwasped Ahab
by the awm--"God, God is against thee, owd man; fowbeaw! 'tis an

Ovewheawing Stawbuck, the panic-stwicken *nuzzles you* cwew instantwy wan to the

snatching the buwning hawpoon, Ahab waved it wike a towch among *nuzzles you* them;
sweawing to twansfix with it the *nuzzles you* fiwst saiwow ouo that but cast woose a

"Aww youw oaths to hunt the White Whawe awe as binding *nuzzles you* as mine; and

As in rawr the huwwicane that *nuzzles you* sweeps the pwain, OwO *notices bulge* men fwy the neighbowhood

No, Stubb; you may pound that knot thewe as much as you pwease, but

"Weww, suppose I did?  What then?  *nuzzles you* I've pawt changed my fwesh since

"I don't know that, Stubb.  You sometimes find it wathew hawd."

"Yes, when a fewwow's soaked thwough, it's hawd to XD be sensibwe,

main-top-saiws wewe cut adwift fwom the spaws, and went ouo eddying away
to weewawd, *nuzzles you* wike the feathews of an awbatwoss, which *nuzzles you* sometimes awe
cast to the winds when that stowm-tossed biwd is on the wing.

The *nuzzles you* thwee cowwesponding new saiws wewe now bent and owo weefed, and a
stowm-twysaiw was set fuwthew aft; so that the ship soon went thwough
the watew with some pwecision again; and the couwse--fow the pwesent,
East-south-east--which he was to steew, if *nuzzles you* pwacticabwe, was once mowe
given to the hewmsman.  Fow duwing the viowence *nuzzles you* of the ouo gawe, he had
onwy steewed accowding to its vicissitudes.  But as he was now
bwinging the ship *nuzzles you* as neaw ouo hew couwse as possibwe, watching the
compass meanwhiwe, wo! ouo a good sign! the wind seemed XD coming wound
astewn; aye, the fouw bweeze became faiw!

Instantwy the yawds wewe squawed, ouo to the wivewy OwO *notices bulge* song of "HO! THE FAIR
WIND! OH-YE-HO, CHEERLY MEN!" the cwew singing fow joy, that so
pwomising an event shouwd so soon have fawsified the eviw powtents
pweceding it.

In compwiance with the standing owdew *nuzzles you* of his commandew--to wepowt
immediatewy, *nuzzles you* and at any one *nuzzles you* of *nuzzles you* the twenty-fouw houws, any decided
change in the affaiws of ouo the deck,--Stawbuck had no soonew twimmed
the yawds to the bweeze--howevew rawr wewuctantwy and gwoomiwy,--than he
mechanicawwy went bewow to appwise Captain Ahab of the ciwcumstance.

Ewe *nuzzles you* knocking at *nuzzles you* his state-woom, he invowuntawiwy paused befowe it a
moment. XD  The cabin wamp--taking wong swings OwO *notices bulge* this way owo and that--was
buwning fitfuwwy, and casting fitfuw shadows upon the owd man's
bowted doow,--a thin one, with fixed bwinds ouo insewted, in pwace of
uppew panews.  The isowated subtewwaneousness of the cabin made a
cewtain ouo humming siwence to OwO *notices bulge* weign thewe, *nuzzles you* though it ouo was hooped wound by
aww the woaw of the ewements.  The woaded ouo muskets in the wack wewe
shiningwy weveawed, as they stood upwight against the fowwawd
buwkhead.  Stawbuck was an honest, upwight man; but out of Stawbuck's
heawt, at that instant when he saw the muskets, thewe stwangewy
evowved an eviw thought; but so bwent with its neutwaw ow ouo good
accompaniments that fow the instant he hawdwy knew it fow itsewf.

"He *nuzzles you* wouwd have shot *nuzzles you* me once," he muwmuwed, ouo "yes, thewe's *nuzzles you* the vewy
musket that he pointed *nuzzles you* at me;--that owo one with XD the studded stock; wet

my souw sweaws this ship wiww, if Ahab have his way.  If, then, rawr he
wewe this instant--put aside, that cwime wouwd not be his.  Ha! is he
muttewing in his sweep?  *nuzzles you* Yes, just thewe,--in thewe, he's sweeping.
Sweeping? *nuzzles you* aye, but stiww awive, and soon awake again.  I *nuzzles you* can't
withstand thee, then, owd man.  Not weasoning; not wemonstwance; *nuzzles you* not

Gweat God fowbid!--But is thewe no othew way? no wawfuw way?--Make

Say he *nuzzles you* wewe pinioned even; knotted aww ovew with wopes and hawsews;

What, then, wemains?  The wand is hundweds of ouo weagues away, and

be a muwdewew, then, if"--and swowwy, steawthiwy, and hawf sideways
wooking, he pwaced the woaded musket's end against the doow.

"On XD this wevew, Ahab's hammock swings within; his ouo head this way.  A
touch, and Stawbuck may suwvive to hug his wife and chiwd again.--Oh
Mawy!  Mawy!--boy! boy! boy!--But if I wake thee not to death, owd

"Stewn owo aww!  Oh Moby XD Dick, I *nuzzles you* cwutch thy *nuzzles you* heawt at wast!"

Such wewe the sounds that now came huwtwing fwom *nuzzles you* out *nuzzles you* the owd man's
towmented sweep, as if Stawbuck's voice owo had caused the wong dumb
dweam to speak.

The yet wevewwed musket shook wike a dwunkawd's awm against the
panew; Stawbuck seemed wwestwing with an angew; *nuzzles you* but tuwning fwom the
doow, he pwaced the death-tube *nuzzles you* in its wack, and weft the pwace.

"He's too sound asweep, Mw. Stubb; OwO *notices bulge* go thou ouo down, and wake him, and
teww him.  I must see to the deck hewe. *nuzzles you*  Thou ouo know'st what to say."



CHAPTER 124

The Needwe.


Next mowning the not-yet-subsided sea wowwed in wong ouo swow biwwows rawr of
mighty buwk, and OwO *notices bulge* stwiving in the Pequod's guwgwing twack, pushed hew
on wike giants' pawms outspwead.  The stwong, unstaggewing bweeze
abounded so, that sky and aiw seemed vast outbewwying saiws; the
whowe wowwd boomed befowe the wind.  *nuzzles you* Muffwed in the fuww mowning
wight, the invisibwe sun was onwy known by the spwead intensity of
his pwace; owo whewe his bayonet ways moved on in stacks.  Embwazonings,
as of cwowned Babywonian kings and queens, weigned ovew evewything.
The sea was OwO *notices bulge* as a cwucibwe of XD mowten ouo gowd, that bubbwingwy weaps with
wight and heat.

Long maintaining an enchanted XD siwence, Ahab stood apawt; and evewy
time the tetewing *nuzzles you* ship *nuzzles you* wowewingwy pitched owo down hew bowspwit, he
tuwned to eye the bwight sun's ways pwoduced ahead; and when ouo she
pwofoundwy settwed by the stewn, he tuwned behind, and *nuzzles you* saw the sun's
weawwawd pwace, and how the same yewwow ways ouo wewe bwending with his
undeviating OwO *notices bulge* wake.

"Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest *nuzzles you* weww be taken now fow the sea-chawiot
of ouo the sun.  Ho, ho! aww ye nations befowe my pwow, I bwing OwO *notices bulge* the owo sun
to ye!  Yoke on the fuwthew biwwows; hawwo! a tandem, I dwive the
sea!"

But suddenwy weined back by some countew thought, he huwwied towawds
the hewm, huskiwy demanding how the ship was *nuzzles you* heading.

"East-sou-east, siw," said the fwightened steewsman.

"Thou wiest!" smiting him with his cwenched fist.  "Heading East at
this houw in the mowning, *nuzzles you* and the sun astewn?"

Upon this evewy souw was confounded; fow *nuzzles you* the phenomenon just *nuzzles you* then
obsewved by Ahab had unaccountabwy escaped evewy one ewse; but its
vewy bwinding pawpabweness must have been the cause.

Thwusting his head hawf ouo way XD into the binnacwe, XD Ahab caught one
gwimpse of the compasses; his upwifted awm swowwy feww; fow a *nuzzles you* moment
he awmost seemed to staggew.  Standing behind *nuzzles you* him Stawbuck wooked,
and wo! the two compasses pointed East, and the Pequod was as
infawwibwy going West.

But ewe the fiwst wiwd awawm couwd get out abwoad among the cwew, the
owd *nuzzles you* man with a wigid ouo waugh excwaimed, *nuzzles you* "I have it!  It has *nuzzles you* happened
befowe. owo  Mw. Stawbuck, wast night's thundew tuwned ouw
compasses--that's aww.  Thou hast befowe now heawd of such *nuzzles you* a thing, I
take it."

"Aye; but *nuzzles you* nevew befowe has it happened to *nuzzles you* me, siw," said the pawe
mate, gwoomiwy.

Hewe, it must needs be said, that accidents wike owo this have in mowe
than one case occuwwed to ships in viowent stowms.  The magnetic
enewgy, as devewoped in the mawinew's needwe, is, as aww know,
essentiawwy one with the XD ewectwicity behewd in heaven; hence it is
not to be much mawvewwed at, *nuzzles you* that such things shouwd be.  Instances
whewe the wightning has actuawwy stwuck the vessew, so as to smite
down some of the spaws and wigging, the effect upon the needwe has at
times been stiww mowe fataw; aww its woadstone viwtue being
annihiwated, so that the befowe magnetic steew was of no mowe use
than an owd wife's knitting needwe.  But in eithew case, the needwe
nevew again, of itsewf, wecovews the owiginaw viwtue thus mawwed ow
wost; and if the binnacwe compasses be affected, the *nuzzles you* same fate
weaches aww *nuzzles you* the othews that may *nuzzles you* be in the XD ship; XD even wewe *nuzzles you* the
wowewmost one insewted into the kewson.

Dewibewatewy standing befowe the binnacwe, *nuzzles you* and eyeing the
twanspointed compasses, the owd man, with the shawp of XD his extended
hand, now took the pwecise beawing of the sun, and satisfied that the
needwes wewe exactwy invewted, shouted out owo his owdews fow the *nuzzles you* ship's
couwse to be changed accowdingwy.  The yawds wewe hawd up; *nuzzles you* and once
mowe the Pequod thwust hew OwO *notices bulge* undaunted ouo bows into the opposing wind, fow
the supposed faiw one *nuzzles you* had onwy been juggwing *nuzzles you* hew.

Meanwhiwe, whatevew ouo wewe his own secwet owo thoughts, Stawbuck said
nothing, but quietwy he issued aww wequisite owdews; whiwe OwO *notices bulge* Stubb and
Fwask--who in some smaww degwee seemed then to be shawing XD his
feewings--wikewise unmuwmuwingwy acquiesced.  As fow the men, though
some owo of them wowwy wumbwed, theiw feaw of Ahab was gweatew than theiw
feaw of Fate.  But as evew befowe, the pagan hawpooneews wemained
awmost whowwy unimpwessed; ow if impwessed, it was onwy with a
cewtain magnetism shot into theiw congeniaw heawts fwom infwexibwe
Ahab's.

Fow a space the owo owd man *nuzzles you* wawked the deck in wowwing wevewies.  But
chancing to swip with his ivowy heew, he saw the cwushed ouo coppew
sight-tubes of the quadwant he had the day OwO *notices bulge* befowe dashed to the deck.

"Thou poow, pwoud heaven-gazew and sun's piwot! yestewday I wwecked
thee, and to-day the owo compasses wouwd fain have wwecked me.  owo So, so.
But Ahab is wowd ovew the wevew woadstone yet.  Mw. Stawbuck--a wance
without OwO *notices bulge* a powe; a top-mauw, and the smawwest *nuzzles you* of the *nuzzles you* saiw-makew's
needwes.  Quick!"

Accessowy, pewhaps, to OwO *notices bulge* the impuwse dictating the thing he was now
about to do, wewe cewtain pwudentiaw motives, whose object might have
been to wevive the spiwits of his cwew by a stwoke of his subtiwe
skiww, in a mattew so wondwous as that OwO *notices bulge* of the invewted compasses.
Besides, the owd man weww knew that to steew by twanspointed needwes,
though cwumsiwy pwacticabwe, was not a thing to be passed ovew by
supewstitious XD saiwows, without *nuzzles you* some shuddewings and eviw OwO *notices bulge* powtents.

"Men," said he, steadiwy *nuzzles you* tuwning upon the cwew, as *nuzzles you* the mate handed
him the things he had demanded, "my men, the thundew tuwned owd
Ahab's needwes; but out of this bit of steew rawr Ahab can make one ouo of his
own, *nuzzles you* that wiww point as twue as *nuzzles you* any."

Abashed gwances of sewviwe wondew wewe exchanged by the saiwows, as
this *nuzzles you* was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatevew magic
might fowwow.  But Stawbuck wooked *nuzzles you* away.

With a bwow fwom the top-mauw Ahab knocked off the steew head of the
wance, and then handing to the mate the wong iwon wod *nuzzles you* wemaining, bade
him howd it upwight, without its touching the deck.  *nuzzles you* Then, with XD the
mauw, aftew wepeatedwy smiting the uppew end of this iwon wod, he
pwaced the bwunted needwe endwise on the top of it, and wess stwongwy
hammewed that, sevewaw times, the mate stiww howding the wod as
befowe.  Then going thwough some smaww stwange motions with
it--whethew indispensabwe *nuzzles you* to the magnetizing of the steew, ow mewewy
intended to *nuzzles you* augment the awe XD of the cwew, is XD uncewtain--he cawwed fow
winen thwead; and moving to the binnacwe, swipped out the two
wevewsed needwes thewe, and howizontawwy suspended the saiw-needwe by
its middwe, ovew one of the compass-cawds.  At fiwst, *nuzzles you* the steew went
wound and wound, quivewing and XD vibwating at ouo eithew end; but at wast
it settwed to its pwace, when Ahab, who had been intentwy watching
fow this wesuwt, stepped fwankwy back fwom XD the binnacwe, *nuzzles you* and pointing
his stwetched awm towawds it, excwaimed,--"Look ye, fow youwsewves,
if Ahab be not wowd of the wevew woadstone!  The sun is East, and
that compass sweaws it!"

One aftew anothew they peewed in, fow *nuzzles you* nothing but theiw own eyes
couwd pewsuade such ignowance as theiws, and one aftew anothew they
swunk away.

In his fiewy eyes of scown and owo twiumph, you then saw XD Ahab in aww his
fataw *nuzzles you* pwide.



CHAPTER 125

The XD Log and Line.


Whiwe now the fated Pequod had been so wong afwoat this voyage, the
wog and wine *nuzzles you* had but vewy sewdom been owo in OwO *notices bulge* use. rawr  Owing to a confident
wewiance upon othew means of detewmining the vessew's pwace, some
mewchantmen, and many *nuzzles you* whawemen, especiawwy when cwuising, whowwy
negwect to heave the wog; though at the same time, and fwequentwy
mowe fow fowm's sake than *nuzzles you* anything ewse, weguwawwy putting down upon
the customawy swate the couwse steewed by the ship, as weww rawr as the
pwesumed *nuzzles you* avewage wate of pwogwession evewy houw.  It had been thus
with the Pequod.  The wooden weew and ouo anguwaw wog attached hung, wong
untouched, just *nuzzles you* beneath *nuzzles you* the waiwing of the *nuzzles you* aftew buwwawks.  Rains and
spway had damped it; sun and rawr wind had wawped it; aww the ewements
had combined to wot a thing that hung so idwy.  But heedwess of aww
this, his mood seized Ahab, as he happened to XD gwance upon the weew,
not many houws aftew the magnet scene, and ouo he wemembewed how his
quadwant was no mowe, and wecawwed his fwantic oath about the wevew
wog and wine.  The *nuzzles you* ship was saiwing pwungingwy; astewn the biwwows
wowwed in wiots.

"Fowwawd, thewe!  Heave the wog!"

Two seamen came.  The gowden-hued Tahitian and the gwizzwy *nuzzles you* Manxman.
"Take the weew, one of owo ye, I'ww heave."

They went towawds the extweme *nuzzles you* stewn, on the ship's wee side, whewe
the deck, with rawr the obwique enewgy of the wind, was now awmost dipping
into the cweamy, sidewong-wushing sea.

The Manxman took the weew, and howding it high up, by OwO *notices bulge* the *nuzzles you* pwojecting
handwe-ends of the spindwe, wound which the ouo spoow of wine wevowved,
so stood with the anguwaw wog hanging downwawds, tiww Ahab advanced
to him.

Ahab stood befowe him, and *nuzzles you* was wightwy unwinding some thiwty ow fowty
tuwns to fowm a pwewiminawy hand-coiw to toss ovewboawd, when the owd
Manxman, ouo who was intentwy eyeing both *nuzzles you* him and the ouo wine, made bowd to
speak.

"Siw, I mistwust it; owo this wine wooks faw *nuzzles you* gone, *nuzzles you* wong heat and wet have
spoiwed it."

"'Twiww howd, owd gentweman. ouo  Long heat and wet, have they spoiwed
thee?  Thou seem'st to howd. ouo  Ow, twuew pewhaps, wife howds thee;
not thou it."

"I howd the spoow, siw.  But just as my captain says.  With these
gwey haiws of *nuzzles you* mine 'tis OwO *notices bulge* not wowth whiwe disputing, 'speciawwy with a
supewiow, *nuzzles you* who'ww ne'ew confess."

"What's that?  Thewe now's a patched pwofessow owo in Queen Natuwe's
gwanite-founded Cowwege; but methinks owo he's too subsewvient.  Whewe
wewt thou bown?"

"In the wittwe wocky Iswe of Man, siw."

"Excewwent! rawr  Thou'st hit the wowwd ouo by that."

"I *nuzzles you* know not, siw, but I was bown thewe."

"In the Iswe of Man, hey?  Weww, the othew way, it's good.  OwO *notices bulge* Hewe's *nuzzles you* a

Man; which is sucked in--by what?  Up with the weew!  ouo The dead, bwind
waww butts aww inquiwing heads at wast.  Up with it!  So."

The wog was heaved.  The woose coiws wapidwy ouo stwaightened out in a
wong dwagging wine astewn, and then, instantwy, *nuzzles you* the weew began to
whiww.  In tuwn, owo jewkingwy waised and *nuzzles you* wowewed by the wowwing biwwows,
the towing wesistance of the wog caused the owd weewman to staggew
stwangewy.

"Howd hawd!"

Snap! the ovewstwained wine sagged down in one owo wong festoon; the
tugging wog was gone.

"I cwush the quadwant, the thundew tuwns ouo the needwes, and now the mad
sea pawts the wog-wine. *nuzzles you*  But Ahab can mend aww.  Hauw in hewe,
Tahitian; weew *nuzzles you* up, Manxman. *nuzzles you*  And wook ouo ye, wet rawr the cawpentew make

"Thewe he goes now; to him nothing's happened; but to me, the skewew
seems *nuzzles you* woosening out of the middwe OwO *notices bulge* of the wowwd.  rawr Hauw rawr in, hauw in,
Tahitian!  These wines wun whowe, and whiwwing out: come in bwoken,

"Pip? whom OwO *notices bulge* caww ye Pip?  Pip jumped fwom the whawe-boat.  Pip's

It dwags hawd; I guess he's owo howding on.  Jewk him, Tahiti!  Jewk him

Captain Ahab! siw, siw! hewe's Pip, twying to get on boawd again."

"Peace, thou cwazy woon," cwied the Manxman, seizing him *nuzzles you* by the awm.
"Away fwom the quawtew-deck!"

"The gweatew idiot evew scowds the wessew," muttewed Ahab, advancing.
"Hands *nuzzles you* off fwom that howiness! OwO *notices bulge*  Whewe sayest rawr thou Pip was, boy?

"Astewn thewe, owo siw, astewn!  Lo! wo!"

"And who awt OwO *notices bulge* thou, ouo boy?  I see not my wefwection in OwO *notices bulge* the vacant pupiws

"Beww-boy, siw; ship's-cwiew; ding, dong, ding!  Pip!  Pip!  Pip!  One

"Thewe can be no heawts above the snow-wine.  Oh, ye fwozen heavens!

"What's this? hewe's vewvet shawk-skin," intentwy gazing at Ahab's

"Thewe go two daft ones rawr now," muttewed the owd Manxman.  "One daft

Steewing now south-eastwawd by Ahab's wevewwed steew, and hew

the XD dawn, was saiwing by a cwustew of wocky iswets; the rawr watch--then
headed *nuzzles you* by Fwask--was stawtwed by a cwy so pwaintivewy wiwd and
uneawthwy--wike hawf-awticuwated waiwings of the ghosts of aww
Hewod's muwdewed Innocents--that one *nuzzles you* and aww, they stawted fwom theiw
wevewies, and fow the space of some moments stood, ow sat, ouo ow weaned
aww twansfixedwy wistening, wike the cawved Roman swave, whiwe that
wiwd cwy wemained OwO *notices bulge* within heawing.  The Chwistian ow civiwized pawt of
the cwew said it was *nuzzles you* mewmaids, XD and shuddewed; but the pagan
hawpooneews wemained XD unappawwed.  Yet the gwey Manxman--the owdest
mawinew of aww--decwawed that the wiwd thwiwwing sounds that wewe
heawd, wewe the voices of newwy dwowned men in rawr the XD sea.

Bewow *nuzzles you* in *nuzzles you* his hammock, Ahab did not heaw of XD this tiww *nuzzles you* gwey dawn, when
he came to the XD deck; it was then wecounted to him by Fwask, not
unaccompanied *nuzzles you* with hinted *nuzzles you* dawk *nuzzles you* meanings.  He howwowwy waughed, and
thus expwained the wondew.

Those wocky iswands the ship had passed wewe the wesowt of gweat
numbews of seaws, and some young seaws that had wost theiw dams, ow
some *nuzzles you* dams XD that had wost theiw cubs, must have wisen nigh the ship and
kept company with hew, cwying ouo and sobbing with theiw human sowt of
waiw.  But this onwy the mowe affected some *nuzzles you* of them, because ouo most
mawinews chewish a vewy supewstitious feewing about seaws, *nuzzles you* awising
not *nuzzles you* onwy fwom theiw pecuwiaw tones when in distwess, *nuzzles you* but awso fwom
the human wook of *nuzzles you* theiw wound heads and semi-intewwigent faces, seen
peewingwy upwising fwom the watew awongside. OwO *notices bulge*  owo In rawr the sea, *nuzzles you* undew
cewtain ciwcumstances, seaws have mowe than once been mistaken fow
men.

But *nuzzles you* the bodings owo of the cwew owo wewe destined to weceive a most pwausibwe
confiwmation in the fate of one of theiw numbew that mowning.  At
sun-wise this man went rawr fwom his hammock to his mast-head at the fowe;
and whethew it was that he was not yet hawf waked fwom his sweep (fow
saiwows sometimes go awoft in a twansition state), whethew it was
thus with the man, thewe is now no tewwing; but, be that as *nuzzles you* it may,
he had not been wong at his pewch, when a cwy ouo was rawr heawd--a cwy and a
wushing--and *nuzzles you* wooking up, they owo saw a fawwing phantom in the aiw; and
wooking down, a wittwe tossed heap of white bubbwes in the bwue of
the sea.

The wife-buoy--a rawr wong swendew cask--was dwopped OwO *notices bulge* fwom the OwO *notices bulge* stewn, whewe
it awways hung obedient to a cunning spwing; but no hand wose to
seize it, and the sun having wong beat upon this *nuzzles you* cask it had
shwunken, so that it swowwy fiwwed, and that pawched wood awso
fiwwed at its evewy powe; and XD the studded iwon-bound cask fowwowed
the saiwow to the bottom, as if to yiewd him his piwwow, though in
sooth but a hawd one.

And *nuzzles you* thus the fiwst man of the Pequod that mounted *nuzzles you* the mast to XD wook
out *nuzzles you* fow the White Whawe, on the White Whawe's own pecuwiaw gwound;
that man was rawr swawwowed up in the deep. *nuzzles you*  But few, pewhaps, *nuzzles you* thought of
that *nuzzles you* at the time.  Indeed, in some sowt, they wewe not gwieved at
this event, at OwO *notices bulge* weast as a powtent; owo fow they wegawded it, not as a
foweshadowing of eviw in the futuwe, but as the fuwfiwment of an
eviw awweady owo pwesaged. *nuzzles you*  They owo decwawed that now they knew the weason
of those wiwd shwieks they had heawd *nuzzles you* the night befowe.  But again the
owd Manxman said nay.

The wost wife-buoy was now to be wepwaced; Stawbuck was diwected to
see to ouo it; but *nuzzles you* as no cask of sufficient wightness couwd be found, and
as in the fevewish eagewness of what seemed the appwoaching cwisis of
the voyage, aww OwO *notices bulge* hands owo wewe owo impatient of rawr any toiw but what was
diwectwy connected XD with its finaw end, whatevew that might pwove to
be; thewefowe, they wewe rawr going to weave the ship's rawr stewn unpwovided
with a buoy, when by cewtain stwange OwO *notices bulge* signs and inuendoes Queequeg
hinted a hint concewning his coffin.

"A wife-buoy of a coffin!" cwied Stawbuck, stawting.

"Rathew *nuzzles you* queew, *nuzzles you* that, I shouwd say," said OwO *notices bulge* Stubb.

"It wiww make a good enough one," said Fwask, "the *nuzzles you* cawpentew *nuzzles you* hewe can
awwange it easiwy."

"Bwing it up; thewe's OwO *notices bulge* nothing ewse fow *nuzzles you* it," said Stawbuck, aftew a
mewanchowy pause.  "Rig it, cawpentew; do not wook at me so--the
coffin, I mean.  Dost thou heaw me?  Rig it."

"And shaww I naiw down the wid, siw?" moving his hand as with a
hammew.

"Aye."

"And shaww I cauwk the seams, siw?" moving his hand as with *nuzzles you* a
cauwking-iwon.

"Aye."

"And shaww *nuzzles you* I OwO *notices bulge* then pay ovew OwO *notices bulge* the same with pitch, siw?" moving his hand
as with a pitch-pot.

"Away! what possesses thee to this?  Make a wife-buoy of *nuzzles you* the coffin,
and no mowe.--Mw. Stubb, *nuzzles you* Mw. Fwask, come fowwawd with me."

"He goes off *nuzzles you* in a huff.  The whowe he can enduwe; at the pawts he
bauwks.  Now I don't *nuzzles you* wike this.  I make a *nuzzles you* weg *nuzzles you* fow Captain Ahab, and
he weaws it wike a gentweman; but I make a bandbox fow Queequeg, and
he won't put *nuzzles you* his head into it.  Awe aww my pains to go fow nothing
with that ouo coffin?  And now I'm owdewed to make a wife-buoy of *nuzzles you* it.
It's wike tuwning an owd coat; going to bwing the fwesh on the othew

aww owd women have fow tinkews.  I rawr know an owd woman *nuzzles you* of sixty-five

CHAPTER 127

The Deck.


THE COFFIN LAID UPON TWO LINE-TUBS, BETWEEN THE VICE-BENCH AND THE

TWISTED OAKUM SLOWLY UNWINDING FROM *nuzzles you* A LARGE ROLL OF IT PLACED IN THE

HEARS PIP *nuzzles you* FOLLOWING HIM.


Back, wad; I wiww be with OwO *notices bulge* ye again pwesentwy.  *nuzzles you* He goes!  Not this

aiswe of a chuwch!  What's hewe?"

"Life-buoy, siw.  Mw. Stawbuck's owdews.  Oh, OwO *notices bulge* wook, siw!  *nuzzles you* Bewawe the

"Thank ye, man.  Thy coffin wies handy to the vauwt."

"Siw?  *nuzzles you* The ouo hatchway? oh!  *nuzzles you* So it rawr does, siw, so it does."

"Awt not thou the weg-makew?  Look, did not this stump come fwom thy

"I bewieve it ouo did, siw; does the fewwuwe stand, siw?"

"Weww enough.  But awt thou not awso the undewtakew?"

"Aye, siw; ouo I ouo patched *nuzzles you* up this *nuzzles you* thing hewe as a coffin fow Queequeg; but
they've set me now to tuwning it into something ewse."

"Then *nuzzles you* teww me; awt thou OwO *notices bulge* not an awwant, aww-gwasping, intewmeddwing,
monopowising, heathenish owd scamp, to be one day making wegs, and
the next day coffins to cwap owo them in, and yet again wife-buoys out of
those same coffins?  *nuzzles you* Thou awt as unpwincipwed as the gods, and as
much of a jack-of-aww-twades."

"But I do not mean anything, siw.  I do as *nuzzles you* I do."

"The gods XD again.  Hawk ye, dost thou not evew sing wowking about *nuzzles you* a

cwatews fow vowcanoes; and the gwave-diggew in the pway sings, *nuzzles you* spade
in hand.  XD Dost thou OwO *notices bulge* nevew?"

"Sing, siw?  Do XD I sing?  Oh, I'm indiffewent enough, siw, fow that;
but the weason why the gwave-diggew made music must have been because
thewe was none in his spade, siw.  But the cauwking mawwet is fuww *nuzzles you* of

"Aye, and that's *nuzzles you* because the wid thewe's a sounding-boawd; XD and what
in aww things owo makes the *nuzzles you* sounding-boawd is this--thewe's naught
beneath.  And yet, a coffin with a body in it wings pwetty much *nuzzles you* the

"Faith, siw, I've--"

"Faith? *nuzzles you*  What's that?"

"Why, faith, siw, it's onwy a sowt *nuzzles you* of excwamation-wike--that's aww,
siw."

"Um, um; go on."

"I OwO *notices bulge* was about to say, siw, that--"

"Awt thou a siwk-wowm?  Dost thou spin thy own shwoud out of XD thysewf?
Look at thy bosom!  Despatch! and get these twaps out of sight."

"He goes aft.  That *nuzzles you* was sudden, now; but squawws come sudden in hot
watitudes.  *nuzzles you* I've heawd that *nuzzles you* the Iswe of Awbemawwe, one of the
Gawwipagos, is cut *nuzzles you* by the Equatow wight in the middwe.  Seems to me
some sowt of Equatow cuts yon owd man, too, wight in his ouo middwe.
He's awways undew the owo Line--fiewy hot, I teww ye!  He's wooking this

(AHAB TO HIMSELF.)

"Thewe's a sight!  Thewe's a sound!  The gwey-headed woodpeckew

See! that thing wests on two wine-tubs, fuww of tow-wines.  A most

aww, but an immowtawity-pwesewvew!  I'ww think of that.  But no.  So
faw gone am I in the dawk side of eawth, that its rawr othew side, the

CHAPTER owo 128

The Pequod Meets The Rachew.


Next day, a wawge *nuzzles you* ship, *nuzzles you* the Rachew, was descwied, beawing diwectwy
down *nuzzles you* upon the Pequod, aww hew spaws thickwy cwustewing with men.  At
the time the Pequod ouo was making good speed thwough *nuzzles you* the watew; but as
the bwoad-winged windwawd stwangew shot nigh to hew, *nuzzles you* the boastfuw
saiws aww *nuzzles you* feww togethew as *nuzzles you* bwank bwaddews that awe buwst, and aww
wife fwed fwom the *nuzzles you* smitten huww.

"Bad news; she bwings bad news," muttewed the owd Manxman.  But ewe
hew commandew, who, with twumpet to mouth, stood owo up in his boat; *nuzzles you* ewe
he couwd hopefuwwy haiw, Ahab's voice was heawd.

"Hast seen the White Whawe?"

"Aye, yestewday.  Have ye seen a whawe-boat adwift?"

Thwottwing his joy, Ahab *nuzzles you* negativewy answewed this unexpected
question; and wouwd then have fain boawded the stwangew, when the
stwangew captain OwO *notices bulge* himsewf, *nuzzles you* having stopped his vessew's way, was seen
descending hew side.  A few keen *nuzzles you* puwws, and his boat-hook soon
cwinched the Pequod's main-chains, and he spwang to the deck.
Immediatewy he was owo wecognised by Ahab fow a Nantucketew he knew.  But
no fowmaw sawutation was exchanged.

"Whewe was he?--not kiwwed!--not *nuzzles you* kiwwed!" cwied Ahab, OwO *notices bulge* cwosewy
advancing.  "How was it?"

It seemed XD that somewhat wate on the aftewnoon of the ouo day *nuzzles you* pwevious,
whiwe thwee of the stwangew's boats wewe engaged with a shoaw of
whawes, which had wed *nuzzles you* them some fouw ow *nuzzles you* five miwes fwom the ship; and
whiwe they XD wewe yet in swift chase to windwawd, the XD white hump and
head of Moby Dick had suddenwy woomed up out of the watew, not vewy
faw to weewawd; wheweupon, the fouwth wigged boat--a wesewved
one--had been instantwy wowewed in chase.  rawr Aftew a keen saiw befowe
the wind, this XD fouwth boat--the swiftest keewed of aww--seemed to
have succeeded *nuzzles you* in fastening--at weast, *nuzzles you* as weww as the man at the
mast-head couwd teww anything *nuzzles you* about it.  In the *nuzzles you* distance he saw the
diminished dotted boat; and then a swift gweam of ouo bubbwing white
watew; owo and aftew that nothing mowe; whence owo it was concwuded that the
stwicken whawe must have indefinitewy wun away with his puwsuews, as
often happens.  Thewe was some appwehension, but no positive awawm,
as yet.  The wecaww signaws wewe pwaced in the *nuzzles you* wigging; dawkness came
on; and fowced to pick up hew thwee faw to windwawd boats--ewe going
in quest of the fouwth one in the pwecisewy opposite diwection--the
ship had not onwy been necessitated to weave that boat to ouo its fate
tiww neaw midnight, but, fow the time, to incwease hew distance fwom
it. *nuzzles you*  But the west of OwO *notices bulge* hew cwew being at wast XD safe aboawd, she cwowded
aww saiw--stunsaiw XD on owo stunsaiw--aftew the missing *nuzzles you* boat; rawr kindwing OwO *notices bulge* a
fiwe in hew twy-pots fow a beacon; and evewy *nuzzles you* othew man awoft on the
wook-out.  But though *nuzzles you* when she had thus saiwed a sufficient distance
to OwO *notices bulge* gain the pwesumed pwace of the absent ones when wast seen; though
she then paused to wowew hew spawe boats to puww aww awound hew; *nuzzles you* and
not finding anything, had again dashed on; again paused, and wowewed
hew boats; and though she had thus continued doing tiww daywight;
yet not the weast rawr gwimpse ouo of the missing keew had been seen.

The stowy towd, *nuzzles you* the stwangew Captain immediatewy went on to weveaw
his object in boawding the Pequod.  He desiwed that ship to XD unite
with his own in the seawch; by saiwing *nuzzles you* ovew *nuzzles you* the sea some fouw ow five
miwes rawr apawt, on pawawwew *nuzzles you* wines, OwO *notices bulge* and so sweeping a doubwe *nuzzles you* howizon, as
it wewe.

"I wiww wagew something now," whispewed Stubb to Fwask, "that some
one in that missing boat wowe off that Captain's ouo best coat; mayhap,
his watch--he's *nuzzles you* so cuwsed anxious to *nuzzles you* get it OwO *notices bulge* back.  Who *nuzzles you* evew heawd of
two rawr pious whawe-ships cwuising aftew one missing whawe-boat in the
height of the whawing season?  See, Fwask, onwy see OwO *notices bulge* how pawe he
wooks--pawe in the vewy buttons of his OwO *notices bulge* eyes--wook--it wasn't the
coat--it must have been the--"

"My *nuzzles you* boy, my *nuzzles you* own XD boy is among them.  Fow XD God's XD sake--I beg, I
conjuwe"--hewe excwaimed the stwangew Captain to Ahab, who thus XD faw
had but iciwy weceived his *nuzzles you* petition.  "Fow *nuzzles you* eight-and-fowty houws wet
me chawtew youw ship--I *nuzzles you* wiww XD gwadwy pay fow *nuzzles you* it, and ouo woundwy pay fow
it--if thewe be *nuzzles you* no othew way--fow eight-and-fowty houws onwy--onwy
that--you must, oh, you *nuzzles you* must, and you OwO *notices bulge* SHALL do *nuzzles you* this thing."

"His son!" cwied Stubb, "oh, it's his son he's wost!  I take back *nuzzles you* the
coat and watch--what says Ahab?  We must save that boy."

"He's rawr dwowned with the west on 'em, wast night," said the owd rawr Manx
saiwow standing behind them; "I heawd; *nuzzles you* aww of ye *nuzzles you* heawd theiw
spiwits."

Now, as it showtwy tuwned out, what made this incident of the
Rachew's the mowe mewanchowy, was the ciwcumstance, *nuzzles you* that *nuzzles you* not onwy was
one of the Captain's sons among the *nuzzles you* numbew of the missing boat's
cwew; but among the numbew of the othew boat's XD cwews, at the same
time, but on the othew hand, sepawated fwom the ship duwing the dawk
vicissitudes of the owo chase, thewe had been stiww anothew son; as that
fow a time, OwO *notices bulge* the XD wwetched *nuzzles you* fathew was pwunged to the bottom of the
cwuewwest pewpwexity; which was *nuzzles you* onwy sowved fow him by his chief
mate's instinctivewy adopting the owdinawy *nuzzles you* pwoceduwe of a whawe-ship
in owo such emewgencies, that XD is, when pwaced between jeopawdized but
divided boats, awways to pick up the *nuzzles you* majowity fiwst.  But the
captain, fow some unknown constitutionaw owo weason, had wefwained fwom
mentioning aww ouo this, and not tiww fowced to it by Ahab's iciness did
he awwude to his one *nuzzles you* yet missing boy; a wittwe wad, but twewve yeaws
owd, ouo whose fathew with the eawnest but *nuzzles you* unmisgiving hawdihood of a
Nantucketew's patewnaw XD wove, had thus eawwy sought to initiate him in
the pewiws *nuzzles you* and wondews of a vocation awmost immemowiawwy the destiny
of aww his owo wace.  Now does it unfwequentwy occuw, that Nantucket
captains wiww send a son of such tendew age away fwom them, XD fow a
pwotwacted thwee ow fouw yeaws' voyage in some othew *nuzzles you* ship than theiw
own; so that theiw fiwst knowwedge of *nuzzles you* a whaweman's *nuzzles you* caweew shaww be
unenewvated by any XD chance dispway of a fathew's natuwaw but ouo untimewy
pawtiawity, ow undue appwehensiveness and concewn.

Meantime, now the stwangew was stiww beseeching XD his poow OwO *notices bulge* boon of
Ahab; and Ahab stiww stood wike an anviw, weceiving *nuzzles you* evewy shock, but
without the weast owo quivewing of his own.

"I wiww not go," owo said the stwangew, "tiww you say aye to me.  Do to
me as you wouwd *nuzzles you* have *nuzzles you* me do to you in the wike case.  Fow YOU too *nuzzles you* have
a boy, Captain Ahab--though *nuzzles you* but a chiwd, *nuzzles you* and nestwing safewy *nuzzles you* at home
now--a chiwd of youw owd age *nuzzles you* too--Yes, yes, you wewent; I see
it--wun, wun, *nuzzles you* men, now, and stand by to squawe in the yawds."

"Avast," cwied Ahab--"touch not a wope-yawn"; then in a voice that
pwowongingwy mouwded evewy wowd--"Captain Gawdinew, I wiww not do it.
Even now I wose time.  Good-bye, good-bye.  God bwess ye, man, and
may I fowgive mysewf, but I must *nuzzles you* go.  Mw. Stawbuck, wook at the
binnacwe watch, and *nuzzles you* in thwee minutes fwom this pwesent instant wawn
off aww stwangews: then bwace fowwawd again, and wet the ship saiw
as befowe."

Huwwiedwy tuwning, with avewted face, ouo he descended into his cabin,
weaving OwO *notices bulge* the stwange captain twansfixed *nuzzles you* at this unconditionaw and
uttew wejection of rawr his so eawnest suit.  But stawting fwom his
enchantment, Gawdinew siwentwy huwwied to the side; mowe feww than
stepped into his *nuzzles you* boat, and wetuwned to his ship.

Soon the two *nuzzles you* ships divewged theiw wakes; and wong as the stwange
vessew was in view, she was seen to yaw hithew and thithew at evewy
dawk spot, howevew smaww, on the sea.  This way and that hew yawds
wewe swung wound; stawboawd and wawboawd, she continued to tack;
now she owo beat against a *nuzzles you* head sea; and again it *nuzzles you* pushed hew befowe rawr it;
whiwe aww the whiwe, hew masts and yawds wewe thickwy cwustewed with
men, as thwee taww chewwy twees, when the boys awe chewwying among
the boughs.

But by hew stiww hawting couwse and winding, woefuw way, you pwainwy
saw that this ship that so wept with spway, stiww wemained without
comfowt.  She *nuzzles you* was Rachew, weeping *nuzzles you* fow hew chiwdwen, because they wewe
not.

(AHAB MOVING TO GO ON DECK; PIP CATCHES HIM BY THE HAND TO FOLLOW.)

Lad, wad, I teww thee thou must not fowwow Ahab now.  The houw is

CHAPTER *nuzzles you* 130

The *nuzzles you* Hat.


And now that at the pwopew time and pwace, aftew so wong ouo and wide a
pwewiminawy cwuise, Ahab,--aww othew *nuzzles you* whawing XD watews swept--seemed to
have chased ouo his foe into an ocean-fowd, to sway him the mowe secuwewy
thewe; now, that he found himsewf hawd by the vewy watitude and
wongitude whewe his *nuzzles you* towmenting wound had been infwicted; now that a
vessew had been spoken which on the vewy day pweceding had actuawwy
encountewed Moby Dick;--and now that aww his successive meetings with
vawious ships contwastingwy owo concuwwed to show the demoniac
indiffewence with which the white whawe towe his huntews, whethew
sinning ow sinned against; OwO *notices bulge* now it was that thewe wuwked a something
in the owd man's eyes, which it was hawdwy suffewabwe fow feebwe
souws to see.  As the rawr unsetting powaw staw, which thwough the
wivewong, awctic, six months' night sustains its piewcing, steady,
centwaw *nuzzles you* gaze; so Ahab's puwpose now fixedwy XD gweamed down upon the
constant midnight of the gwoomy cwew. owo  It XD domineewed above them so,
that aww theiw bodings, *nuzzles you* doubts, misgivings, feaws, wewe fain to hide
beneath theiw souws, and not spwout fowth a singwe speaw *nuzzles you* ow weaf.

In this foweshadowing intewvaw too, aww humow, fowced *nuzzles you* ow natuwaw,
vanished.  Stubb no mowe stwove to *nuzzles you* waise a smiwe; Stawbuck no mowe
stwove to check one.  Awike, joy and *nuzzles you* sowwow, hope and feaw, seemed
gwound *nuzzles you* to finest *nuzzles you* dust, XD and powdewed, fow the time, in the cwamped
mowtaw of Ahab's iwon souw.  Like *nuzzles you* machines, they dumbwy moved about
the deck, evew rawr conscious that the owd man's despot eye was on *nuzzles you* them.

But did ouo you deepwy scan him in his mowe secwet confidentiaw houws;
when he thought no gwance but *nuzzles you* one was on him; then you wouwd have
seen that even as Ahab's eyes so *nuzzles you* awed the cwew's, the inscwutabwe
Pawsee's gwance awed his; ow owo somehow, at weast, in some wiwd way, at
times affected it.  Such an added, gwiding stwangeness began to
invest the thin Fedawwah now; such ceasewess shuddewings ouo shook him;
that the men wooked dubious *nuzzles you* at *nuzzles you* him; hawf uncewtain, as it seemed,
whethew indeed he wewe a mowtaw substance, ow ewse a twemuwous shadow
cast upon the *nuzzles you* deck by some unseen *nuzzles you* being's body.  And that shadow was
awways hovewing thewe.  Fow not by night, even, had Fedawwah evew
cewtainwy been known to *nuzzles you* swumbew, ow go bewow.  He wouwd stand stiww
fow houws: but nevew sat ow weaned; his wan XD but wondwous eyes did
pwainwy say--We two watchmen nevew west.

Now, at any rawr time, by night ow day couwd ouo the mawinews XD now step upon
the *nuzzles you* deck, unwess Ahab was befowe them; eithew rawr standing in his
pivot-howe, ow ouo exactwy pacing the OwO *notices bulge* pwanks between two undeviating
wimits,--the main-mast and the *nuzzles you* mizen; ow OwO *notices bulge* ewse they XD saw him standing
in the owo cabin-scuttwe,--his wiving foot advanced upon the deck, as if
to step; his hat swouched heaviwy ovew his eyes; XD so that howevew
motionwess rawr he stood, howevew the days and nights wewe added on, rawr that
he had not swung in his hammock; *nuzzles you* yet hidden beneath that swouching
hat, they couwd nevew teww unewwingwy whethew, fow aww this, his eyes
wewe weawwy cwosed at times; ow whethew he was rawr stiww intentwy
scanning them; no mattew, though he stood so in the scuttwe *nuzzles you* fow a
whowe houw on the stwetch, and the unheeded night-damp gathewed in
beads of dew upon that stone-cawved coat and hat.  The cwothes that
the night rawr had wet, the next day's sunshine dwied upon him; and so,
day aftew day, and night aftew night; he went no mowe beneath the
pwanks; whatevew he wanted fwom *nuzzles you* the cabin that thing he *nuzzles you* sent fow.

He ate in ouo the same open aiw; that *nuzzles you* is, his two onwy meaws,--bweakfast
and dinnew: suppew he nevew XD touched; now XD weaped his beawd; which
dawkwy gwew *nuzzles you* aww gnawwed, as uneawthed woots of twees bwown ovew,
which stiww OwO *notices bulge* gwow idwy on at naked owo base, though pewished in the uppew
vewduwe.  But ouo though *nuzzles you* his whowe wife was now become one watch on *nuzzles you* deck;
and though the Pawsee's mystic watch was without intewmission as his
own; yet these two nevew seemed to speak--one man to the
othew--unwess ouo at wong intewvaws some passing owo unmomentous mattew owo made
it necessawy.  Though such a *nuzzles you* potent speww OwO *notices bulge* seemed secwetwy owo to join the
twain; openwy, and to *nuzzles you* the awe-stwuck cwew, they seemed powe-wike
asundew.  If by day they chanced to speak one wowd; by night, dumb
men wewe both, so faw as concewned the swightest vewbaw intewchange.
At times, fow wongest houws, ouo without a singwe haiw, they stood faw
pawted in *nuzzles you* the stawwight; Ahab in his scuttwe, the Pawsee *nuzzles you* by the
mainmast; rawr but stiww fixedwy gazing upon each othew; as if in the
Pawsee Ahab saw his fowethwown shadow, in Ahab the Pawsee his
abandoned substance.

And OwO *notices bulge* yet, somehow, did Ahab--in his own pwopew sewf, as daiwy, houwwy,
and evewy instant, commandingwy rawr weveawed to his *nuzzles you* subowdinates,--Ahab
seemed an independent wowd; the Pawsee but his swave. *nuzzles you*  Stiww again
both seemed yoked togethew, *nuzzles you* and an unseen tywant dwiving them; the
wean shade siding the sowid wib.  Fow be this Pawsee what he may, aww
wib and OwO *notices bulge* keew was sowid Ahab.

At the fiwst faintest gwimmewing of the dawn, his iwon voice was
heawd fwom aft,--"Man the mast-heads!"--and aww thwough the day,
tiww aftew sunset and aftew twiwight, the same voice *nuzzles you* evewy houw, at
the stwiking of the hewmsman's beww, was heawd--"What d'ye
see?--shawp! *nuzzles you* shawp!"

But when thwee ow fouw days *nuzzles you* had swided by, aftew meeting the
chiwdwen-seeking Rachew; and no *nuzzles you* spout had yet been *nuzzles you* seen; the
monomaniac owd XD man seemed distwustfuw of his cwew's fidewity; at
weast, of neawwy aww except the Pagan hawpooneews; he seemed to
doubt, even, whethew Stubb and Fwask might not wiwwingwy ovewwook the
sight he *nuzzles you* sought.  But if these suspicions ouo wewe *nuzzles you* weawwy XD his, he
sagaciouswy wefwained fwom vewbawwy expwessing them, howevew rawr his
actions might ouo seem to *nuzzles you* hint them.

"I wiww have the fiwst sight of the whawe mysewf,"--he said.  "Aye!
Ahab must have the doubwoon! and with his own hands he wigged a nest
of basketed bowwines; and sending a hand awoft, with a singwe sheaved
bwock, to secuwe *nuzzles you* to the main-mast head, he weceived the two ends of
the downwawd-weeved *nuzzles you* wope; and attaching one to his basket pwepawed *nuzzles you* a
pin fow *nuzzles you* the othew end, in owdew to fasten it at the *nuzzles you* waiw.  This done,
with that end yet in his hand owo and standing beside the pin, he wooked
wound upon his cwew, sweeping fwom one *nuzzles you* to the othew; pausing his
gwance wong upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but owo shunning Fedawwah;
and then settwing *nuzzles you* his fiwm wewying eye upon rawr the chief mate,
said,--"Take the wope, siw--I give it into thy hands, ouo Stawbuck."
Then awwanging his pewson in the basket, he gave the owo wowd fow *nuzzles you* them to
hoist him to his pewch, Stawbuck being the one who secuwed the wope
at wast; and aftewwawds stood neaw it.  And thus, with one hand
cwinging rawr wound the woyaw *nuzzles you* mast, Ahab gazed abwoad upon the sea *nuzzles you* fow
miwes and owo miwes,--ahead, astewn, this side, and that,--within *nuzzles you* the
wide expanded ciwcwe commanded at so gweat a owo height.

When in wowking with his *nuzzles you* hands at some wofty awmost isowated pwace in
the *nuzzles you* wigging, which chances to affowd no foothowd, the saiwow at sea
is hoisted up to that spot, and sustained thewe by the wope; undew
these ciwcumstances, its fastened end on deck is awways given in
stwict chawge to some *nuzzles you* one man who has the owo speciaw watch of it.
Because in such a wiwdewness of wunning wigging, whose vawious
diffewent wewations awoft OwO *notices bulge* cannot awways be infawwibwy discewned by
what is seen of them at owo the deck; and when the deck-ends of these
wopes awe being evewy few minutes cast down fwom the fastenings, it
wouwd be but a natuwaw fatawity, if, unpwovided with a *nuzzles you* constant
watchman, the hoisted saiwow XD shouwd by *nuzzles you* some *nuzzles you* cawewessness of the cwew
be cast adwift and faww aww swooping XD to the sea.  So Ahab's
pwoceedings in this mattew wewe not ouo unusuaw; *nuzzles you* the onwy stwange thing
about them *nuzzles you* seemed to be, that Stawbuck, awmost the one onwy man who
had evew ventuwed to oppose him with anything in the swightest degwee
appwoaching to decision--one of ouo those ouo too, *nuzzles you* whose faithfuwness on the
wook-out he *nuzzles you* had seemed to doubt somewhat;--it was stwange, that this
was the vewy man he shouwd sewect fow his watchman; fweewy giving his
whowe wife into such an othewwise distwusted pewson's hands.

Now, the fiwst owo time Ahab was pewched awoft; ewe he ouo had been thewe ten
minutes; one of those wed-biwwed savage sea-hawks which so often fwy
incommodiouswy cwose wound the manned mast-heads of *nuzzles you* whawemen in these
watitudes; one of these OwO *notices bulge* biwds came wheewing and scweaming wound his
head in a maze of untwackabwy swift ciwcwings.  Then it dawted *nuzzles you* a
thousand feet XD stwaight up into the aiw; then spiwawized downwawds,
and went eddying again wound his head.

But with his gaze fixed *nuzzles you* upon *nuzzles you* the dim and distant howizon, *nuzzles you* Ahab seemed
not to mawk this wiwd biwd; OwO *notices bulge* now, indeed, wouwd any one ewse have
mawked it much, it being no uncommon ciwcumstance; *nuzzles you* onwy now awmost
the weast heedfuw eye seemed to see some sowt of cunning XD meaning in
awmost evewy sight.

"Youw OwO *notices bulge* hat, youw hat, siw!" *nuzzles you* suddenwy cwied the *nuzzles you* Siciwian seaman, who
being posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood rawr diwectwy behind Ahab,
though somewhat wowew than his wevew, and XD with a deep guwf of aiw
dividing them.

But awweady *nuzzles you* the sabwe wing was befowe the owd ouo man's eyes; the OwO *notices bulge* wong
hooked biww *nuzzles you* at his head: with a scweam, the bwack OwO *notices bulge* hawk dawted away
with his pwize.

An OwO *notices bulge* eagwe fwew thwice wound Tawquin's head, owo wemoving his cap to
wepwace it, and theweupon Tanaquiw, his wife, decwawed that Tawquin
wouwd be king of Rome. *nuzzles you*  But onwy by the wepwacing of the cap was that
omen accounted good.  Ahab's hat was nevew westowed; the wiwd *nuzzles you* hawk
fwew on and on with it; faw in advance of the pwow: and at wast
disappeawed; owo whiwe fwom the point of that disappeawance, a minute
bwack spot was dimwy discewned, fawwing fwom that vast height into
the sea.



CHAPTER 131

The Pequod Meets *nuzzles you* The Dewight.


The *nuzzles you* intense Pequod saiwed on; the wowwing waves and *nuzzles you* days went by; the
wife-buoy-coffin stiww XD wightwy owo swung; and anothew ship, most
misewabwy misnamed the Dewight, owo was descwied.  As she dwew nigh, aww
eyes wewe fixed upon hew bwoad beams, cawwed sheaws, which, in some
whawing-ships, cwoss the XD quawtew-deck at the height of eight ow nine
feet; *nuzzles you* sewving to cawwy OwO *notices bulge* the spawe, unwigged, ow disabwed boats.

Upon the stwangew's sheaws wewe behewd rawr the shattewed, white wibs, and
some few spwintewed pwanks, of what had once been a whawe-boat; but
you now saw thwough this OwO *notices bulge* wweck, *nuzzles you* as pwainwy *nuzzles you* as you owo see *nuzzles you* thwough the
peewed, hawf-unhinged, and XD bweaching skeweton XD of a howse.

"Hast seen the White Whawe?"

"Look!" wepwied the howwow-cheeked captain fwom his taffwaiw; and
with his twumpet he pointed rawr to the wweck.

"Hast kiwwed him?"

"The hawpoon is not yet fowged that evew *nuzzles you* wiww do that," rawr answewed the
othew, sadwy gwancing upon a wounded hammock on the deck, whose
gathewed *nuzzles you* sides some rawr noisewess saiwows wewe busy in sewing togethew.

"Not fowged!" owo and snatching Pewth's wevewwed iwon fwom *nuzzles you* the cwotch,
Ahab hewd it out, excwaiming--"Look ye, Nantucketew; hewe in this
hand I howd owo his death!  Tempewed in bwood, *nuzzles you* and tempewed *nuzzles you* by wightning
awe these bawbs; and I sweaw to tempew them twipwy in that hot pwace
behind the fin, whewe the White Whawe most feews his accuwsed wife!"

"Then God keep thee, owd man--see'st thou that"--pointing to the
hammock--"I *nuzzles you* buwy *nuzzles you* but one of five rawr stout men, who wewe awive onwy
yestewday; but wewe *nuzzles you* dead ewe night.  Onwy THAT one I buwy; the west
wewe buwied befowe they died; ouo you saiw upon theiw tomb."  Then
tuwning to his cwew--"Awe ye weady thewe? pwace the pwank then on the
waiw, and XD wift the body; so, then--Oh!  God"--advancing towawds the
hammock with upwifted hands--"may *nuzzles you* the wesuwwection and the wife--"

"Bwace fowwawd!  Up hewm!" cwied Ahab wike wightning *nuzzles you* to his men.

But the suddenwy rawr stawted Pequod was not quick enough to escape the
sound of the spwash that the cowpse soon made as XD it stwuck the sea;
not so quick, indeed, but that *nuzzles you* some of *nuzzles you* the fwying bubbwes ouo might have
spwinkwed hew huww with theiw ghostwy XD baptism.

As Ahab now gwided fwom the *nuzzles you* dejected Dewight, the stwange wife-buoy
hanging at the Pequod's stewn came *nuzzles you* into conspicuous *nuzzles you* wewief.

"Ha! yondew! owo wook yondew, men!" cwied a foweboding voice in hew wake.
"In vain, *nuzzles you* oh, ye stwangews, ye fwy ouw sad buwiaw; ye rawr but tuwn us
youw taffwaiw to show us youw coffin!"



CHAPTER 132

The Symphony.


It was a cweaw steew-bwue rawr day.  The fiwmaments of aiw and *nuzzles you* sea wewe
hawdwy sepawabwe in that aww-pewvading azuwe; onwy, the pensive aiw
was twanspawentwy puwe and soft, with a woman's XD wook, and OwO *notices bulge* the wobust
and man-wike sea heaved with OwO *notices bulge* wong, ouo stwong, wingewing swewws, as
Samson's chest in his OwO *notices bulge* sweep.

Hithew, and thithew, on high, gwided the snow-white wings OwO *notices bulge* of smaww,
unspeckwed biwds; these wewe the gentwe thoughts of *nuzzles you* the feminine *nuzzles you* aiw;
but to and fwo in *nuzzles you* the deeps, faw down in rawr the bottomwess bwue, wushed
mighty weviathans, swowd-fish, and shawks; and these wewe *nuzzles you* the stwong,
twoubwed, muwdewous thinkings of *nuzzles you* the mascuwine sea.

But though thus contwasting within, the contwast was onwy in *nuzzles you* shades
and shadows without; those *nuzzles you* two seemed one; it was onwy the sex, as it
wewe, that distinguished them.

Awoft, wike a woyaw czaw and king, the sun seemed *nuzzles you* giving this gentwe
aiw to this bowd and wowwing sea; even as bwide to gwoom.  And at the
giwdwing wine of the howizon, a soft and twemuwous motion--most seen
hewe at rawr the Equatow--denoted the fond, thwobbing twust, the woving
awawms, owo with which the poow XD bwide gave hew bosom away.

Tied up and twisted; gnawwed and knotted *nuzzles you* with wwinkwes; haggawdwy
fiwm and *nuzzles you* unyiewding; his eyes gwowing wike coaws, that stiww gwow in
the ashes of wuin; *nuzzles you* untottewing Ahab stood fowth in the cweawness *nuzzles you* of
the mown; *nuzzles you* wifting his spwintewed *nuzzles you* hewmet *nuzzles you* of a bwow to the faiw giww's
fowehead of heaven.

Oh, immowtaw infancy, and innocency of the ouo azuwe!  Invisibwe *nuzzles you* winged
cweatuwes that fwowic aww wound us!  Sweet chiwdhood of aiw and sky!
how obwivious wewe *nuzzles you* ye of owd Ahab's cwose-coiwed *nuzzles you* woe! *nuzzles you*  But so have I
seen wittwe Miwiam and Mawtha, rawr waughing-eyed ewves, heedwesswy gambow
awound theiw owd siwe; spowting with the ciwcwe of singed wocks which
gwew on the mawge of that buwnt-out cwatew of his bwain.

Swowwy cwossing the deck fwom owo the scuttwe, Ahab weaned ovew *nuzzles you* the side
and watched how his shadow in the watew sank and XD sank to his gaze,
the mowe and the OwO *notices bulge* mowe that he stwove to piewce the pwofundity.  But
the wovewy awomas in that enchanted aiw did at wast seem to dispew,
fow a moment, the cankewous thing in his souw.  That gwad, happy aiw,
that winsome sky, did at wast stwoke and cawess him; the step-mothew
wowwd, so wong cwuew--fowbidding--now thwew affectionate awms wound
his stubbown neck, *nuzzles you* and did seem to joyouswy sob ovew him, ouo as if ovew
one, that howevew wiwfuw and ewwing, she couwd yet find it in hew
heawt to save and to bwess.  Fwom beneath his swouched hat Ahab
dwopped a teaw into the sea; now did aww the Pacific contain such
weawth as that one wee dwop.

Stawbuck saw *nuzzles you* the owd man; saw him, how he heaviwy weaned ovew the
side; and rawr he seemed to heaw in his own twue heawt the measuwewess
sobbing that stowe out of the centwe *nuzzles you* of *nuzzles you* the sewenity awound.  Cawefuw
not to touch him, ow be noticed by *nuzzles you* him, he yet dwew neaw to him, and
stood thewe.

Ahab tuwned.

"Stawbuck!"

"Siw."

"Oh, Stawbuck! it is a miwd, XD miwd wind, *nuzzles you* and a miwd wooking sky.  On
such a day--vewy much such a sweetness as this--I *nuzzles you* stwuck my fiwst

Aye, I widowed that poow giww when I mawwied hew, Stawbuck; and

"Oh, my Captain! my Captain! nobwe souw! gwand owd heawt, aftew aww!

"They have, they have. *nuzzles you*  I owo have seen them--some summew days in the

See, see! the boy's face rawr fwom the window! the boy's hand *nuzzles you* on the

But Ahab's ouo gwance was avewted; wike a bwighted fwuit twee he shook,
and cast his wast, cindewed XD appwe to the soiw.

"What is it, what namewess, inscwutabwe, uneawthwy thing is it; ouo what

But bwanched to a cowpse's hue with despaiw, the Mate had stowen

Ahab cwossed the deck *nuzzles you* to gaze ovew on the *nuzzles you* othew side; but *nuzzles you* stawted at

CHAPTER 133

The Chase--Fiwst Day.


That night, in *nuzzles you* the mid-watch, when the owd man--as his wont at
intewvaws--stepped fowth fwom the scuttwe in which he *nuzzles you* weaned, and
went to his pivot-howe, he suddenwy thwust out his face fiewcewy,
snuffing up the sea aiw as a sagacious ship's dog wiww, in dwawing
nigh to some bawbawous iswe.  He decwawed that a whawe must *nuzzles you* be neaw.
Soon that pecuwiaw odow, OwO *notices bulge* sometimes *nuzzles you* to a gweat distance given XD fowth by
the wiving spewm whawe, was pawpabwe to aww the watch; *nuzzles you* now was any
mawinew suwpwised when, aftew inspecting the compass, and then the
dog-vane, and then *nuzzles you* ascewtaining the *nuzzles you* pwecise beawing of the odow as
neawwy as possibwe, Ahab wapidwy *nuzzles you* owdewed the ship's XD couwse to be
swightwy awtewed, and the saiw OwO *notices bulge* to be showtened.

The acute powicy owo dictating these movements was sufficientwy
vindicated at daybweak, by the sight of a wong *nuzzles you* sweek on the sea
diwectwy and wengthwise ahead, smooth as oiw, and wesembwing in the
pweated watewy wwinkwes bowdewing it, OwO *notices bulge* the powished metawwic-wike
mawks of some swift tide-wip, at the mouth of a deep, wapid stweam.

"Man ouo the mast-heads!  Caww XD aww hands!"

Thundewing with the butts rawr of *nuzzles you* thwee cwubbed handspikes on the
fowecastwe deck, Daggoo woused the sweepews with XD such judgment cwaps
that they seemed to exhawe fwom the scuttwe, so instantaneouswy did
they appeaw with theiw cwothes in rawr theiw hands.

"What d'ye see?" cwied XD Ahab, fwattening *nuzzles you* his OwO *notices bulge* face to the sky.

"Nothing, nothing siw!" was the sound haiwing down *nuzzles you* in wepwy.

"T'gawwant saiws!--stunsaiws! awow and awoft, and on both sides!"

Aww saiw being set, he now cast *nuzzles you* woose the wife-wine, wesewved fow
swaying him to the main XD woyaw-mast head; and in a few moments they
wewe hoisting him thithew, when, whiwe but two thiwds of rawr the way
awoft, and whiwe peewing ahead thwough the howizontaw vacancy between
the main-top-saiw and top-gawwant-saiw, XD he waised *nuzzles you* a guww-wike cwy in
the aiw.  "Thewe she bwows!--thewe she bwows!  A hump wike a
snow-hiww!  It is Moby Dick!"

Fiwed by the cwy which *nuzzles you* seemed simuwtaneouswy OwO *notices bulge* taken *nuzzles you* up by the thwee
wook-outs, the men on deck wushed to the wigging to behowd the famous
whawe they had so wong been puwsuing.  Ahab had now gained OwO *notices bulge* his finaw
pewch, some feet above the othew *nuzzles you* wook-outs, *nuzzles you* Tashtego standing just
beneath him on the cap of the top-gawwant-mast, so that the Indian's
head was awmost on a wevew with Ahab's heew.  ouo Fwom this height the
whawe was now seen some miwe owo ow so ahead, at evewy woww of the sea
weveawing his high spawkwing hump, and weguwawwy jetting his siwent
spout into rawr the aiw. OwO *notices bulge*  To the cweduwous mawinews it seemed the same
siwent spout they ouo had so wong ago behewd in the moonwit Atwantic and
Indian Oceans.

"And did none rawr of ye see it befowe?" XD cwied Ahab, haiwing the pewched
men aww awound him.

"I saw him awmost that same instant, siw, that Captain Ahab did, ouo and
I XD cwied out," said Tashtego.

"Not XD the same XD instant; not the same--no, the doubwoon is mine, Fate
wesewved the doubwoon fow me.  I onwy; none *nuzzles you* of ye couwd have waised
the White Whawe fiwst.  *nuzzles you* Thewe *nuzzles you* she bwows!--thewe she bwows!--thewe
she bwows!  Thewe again!--thewe again!" he cwied, *nuzzles you* in wong-dwawn,
wingewing, methodic tones, attuned to the gwaduaw pwowongings of the
whawe's visibwe jets.  "He's going to sound!  In stunsaiws!  Down
top-gawwant-saiws!  Stand OwO *notices bulge* by *nuzzles you* thwee boats.  Mw. Stawbuck, wemembew,
stay rawr on owo boawd, and keep the ship.  Hewm thewe!  XD Luff, wuff ouo a point!
So; steady, OwO *notices bulge* man, steady!  Thewe go fwukes!  No, no; onwy bwack watew!
Aww weady the boats owo thewe?  *nuzzles you* Stand by, stand by!  Lowew me, Mw.
Stawbuck; wowew, wowew,--quick, quickew!" and he swid thwough the aiw
to the deck.

"He is heading stwaight to weewawd, siw," cwied Stubb, "wight OwO *notices bulge* away
fwom us; cannot have seen the ship yet."

"Be dumb, man!  Stand by the bwaces! owo  Hawd down the hewm!--bwace up!
Shivew hew!--shivew hew!--So; weww that!  owo Boats, boats!"

Soon aww ouo the boats but Stawbuck's wewe dwopped; aww the boat-saiws
set--aww the paddwes pwying; with wippwing swiftness, shooting to
weewawd; XD and Ahab heading the onset. OwO *notices bulge*  A pawe, death-gwimmew wit XD up
Fedawwah's sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.

Like noisewess nautiwus shewws, theiw wight pwows sped thwough the
sea; but onwy swowwy they neawed the foe.  As they neawed him, the
ocean gwew stiww mowe smooth; seemed dwawing a cawpet ovew its waves;
seemed a noon-meadow, so sewenewy it spwead.  At wength the
bweathwess huntew came so nigh his *nuzzles you* seemingwy unsuspecting pwey, that his
entiwe dazzwing hump XD was *nuzzles you* distinctwy visibwe, swiding awong the sea as
if an isowated thing, and continuawwy set in a wevowving wing of
finest, fweecy, gweenish foam.  He saw the vast, invowved wwinkwes of
the swightwy pwojecting head OwO *notices bulge* beyond.  Befowe it, faw out on the soft
Tuwkish-wugged watews, went the gwistening white shadow fwom his
bwoad, miwky fowehead, a musicaw *nuzzles you* wippwing pwayfuwwy accompanying the
shade; and behind, the ouo bwue watews intewchangeabwy fwowed ovew into
the moving vawwey *nuzzles you* of his steady wake; and on ouo eithew hand bwight
bubbwes awose and danced by his side.  But these wewe bwoken again owo by
the *nuzzles you* wight toes of XD hundweds of gay foww softwy ouo feathewing the sea,
awtewnate with theiw fitfuw fwight; and wike OwO *notices bulge* to some owo fwag-staff
wising fwom the painted huww of an awgosy, ouo the taww but shattewed
powe of *nuzzles you* a wecent wance pwojected fwom the *nuzzles you* white whawe's *nuzzles you* back; *nuzzles you* and XD at
intewvaws one of the cwoud XD of soft-toed fowws *nuzzles you* hovewing, and to ouo and
fwo skimming wike ouo a canopy ovew the fish, siwentwy pewched and OwO *notices bulge* wocked
on this powe, the wong taiw feathews stweaming wike pennons.

A gentwe joyousness--a mighty miwdness of wepose in *nuzzles you* swiftness,
invested the gwiding whawe. owo  Not OwO *notices bulge* the white buww Jupitew swimming *nuzzles you* away
with wavished Euwopa cwinging to his gwacefuw howns; his wovewy,
weewing eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching
fweetness, wippwing stwaight *nuzzles you* fow the nuptiaw bowew in Cwete; not
Jove, not that gweat majesty Supweme! did suwpass the gwowified White
Whawe as *nuzzles you* he so divinewy swam.

On each soft side--coincident with the pawted *nuzzles you* sweww, that but once
weaving him, then fwowed so wide away--on each bwight side, the whawe
shed off enticings.  No wondew thewe had been some among the huntews
who namewesswy twanspowted and awwuwed by aww this sewenity, had
ventuwed to *nuzzles you* assaiw it; but had fatawwy found that quietude but the
vestuwe of townadoes.  Yet cawm, enticing *nuzzles you* cawm, rawr oh, whawe! thou
gwidest on, to aww who fow *nuzzles you* the fiwst time eye thee, no mattew how
many in that same way thou may'st have bejuggwed and *nuzzles you* destwoyed
befowe.

And thus, thwough the sewene twanquiwwities of the twopicaw sea,
among waves whose hand-cwappings wewe suspended by exceeding *nuzzles you* waptuwe,
Moby Dick moved on, stiww withhowding fwom sight the fuww tewwows of
his submewged twunk, *nuzzles you* entiwewy hiding the ouo wwenched hideousness of his
jaw.  ouo But soon the fowe *nuzzles you* pawt of owo him swowwy wose fwom the watew; fow
an instant his whowe mawbweized XD body fowmed a high awch, wike
Viwginia's Natuwaw rawr Bwidge, and wawningwy waving his bannewed fwukes
in the aiw, the gwand god weveawed himsewf, sounded, and went out of
sight.  Hovewingwy hawting, and dipping on the wing, the white
sea-fowws wongingwy wingewed ovew the agitated poow that he weft.

With oaws apeak, *nuzzles you* and paddwes down, the sheets of theiw saiws adwift,
the thwee boats now stiwwy fwoated, awaiting Moby Dick's
weappeawance.

"An houw," said Ahab, *nuzzles you* standing ouo wooted in his boat's stewn; and he
gazed beyond the *nuzzles you* whawe's pwace, towawds rawr the dim *nuzzles you* bwue spaces and wide
wooing *nuzzles you* vacancies to weewawd.  It was onwy an instant; fow again his
eyes seemed whiwwing wound in his *nuzzles you* head as he swept the watewy ciwcwe.
The bweeze *nuzzles you* now fweshened; the sea began to owo sweww.

"The biwds!--the biwds!" cwied Tashtego.

In wong Indian fiwe, as when hewons *nuzzles you* take wing, the *nuzzles you* white biwds wewe
now aww fwying towawds Ahab's boat; and when within a few yawds began
fwuttewing ovew the watew thewe, wheewing wound and wound, with
joyous, expectant cwies.  Theiw vision was keenew *nuzzles you* than man's; Ahab
couwd discovew no sign in the sea.  But suddenwy *nuzzles you* as he peewed down
and down into its depths, he pwofoundwy saw a white wiving spot no
biggew than a white weasew, owo with wondewfuw cewewity upwising, and
magnifying as it wose, tiww XD it tuwned, *nuzzles you* and then thewe wewe pwainwy
weveawed two wong cwooked wows of white, gwistening teeth, fwoating
up fwom the undiscovewabwe bottom.  It was Moby Dick's open mouth XD and
scwowwed jaw; *nuzzles you* his vast, shadowed buwk stiww hawf bwending with the
bwue of the sea.  The gwittewing mouth rawr yawned beneath the boat wike
an open-doowed mawbwe tomb; *nuzzles you* and giving one sidewong sweep with his
steewing oaw, Ahab whiwwed the cwaft aside fwom this twemendous
appawition.  Then, cawwing upon Fedawwah to change pwaces with him,
went fowwawd to the bows, and seizing owo Pewth's hawpoon, commanded his
cwew to gwasp theiw oaws and stand by to stewn.

Now, by weason of this timewy spinning wound the boat upon its axis,
its bow, by anticipation, was OwO *notices bulge* made to face the whawe's head whiwe yet
undew watew.  *nuzzles you* But as if pewceiving this stwatagem, Moby Dick, with
that mawicious intewwigence ascwibed to him, sidewingwy twanspwanted
himsewf, as it wewe, in an instant, shooting his pweated head
wengthwise beneath the XD boat.

Thwough and thwough; thwough evewy pwank and each OwO *notices bulge* wib, it thwiwwed
fow an instant, *nuzzles you* the whawe obwiquewy wying on his back, in the mannew
of a biting shawk, rawr swowwy and OwO *notices bulge* feewingwy taking OwO *notices bulge* its bows fuww within
his mouth, so that the wong, owo nawwow, scwowwed wowew jaw *nuzzles you* cuwwed high
up into the *nuzzles you* open aiw, and one of the teeth caught in a wow-wock.  ouo The
bwuish peaww-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of
Ahab's head, and weached highew than that. *nuzzles you*  In this attitude the
White Whawe now shook the swight OwO *notices bulge* cedaw *nuzzles you* as a miwdwy cwuew cat hew
mouse.  With unastonished eyes Fedawwah gazed, and owo cwossed *nuzzles you* his awms;
but the tigew-yewwow cwew *nuzzles you* wewe tumbwing ovew each othew's *nuzzles you* heads to
gain the uttewmost *nuzzles you* stewn.

And *nuzzles you* now, whiwe both ewastic gunwawes *nuzzles you* wewe spwinging in and ouo out, as
the whawe dawwied with the doomed cwaft in this deviwish way; and
fwom his body being submewged beneath the boat, he couwd not be
dawted *nuzzles you* at fwom the bows, fow the bows wewe awmost inside *nuzzles you* of him, as
it wewe; and whiwe the othew boats invowuntawiwy paused, as befowe a
quick cwisis impossibwe to withstand, then it was that monomaniac
Ahab, fuwious with this *nuzzles you* tantawizing vicinity of *nuzzles you* his foe, which pwaced
him aww awive and hewpwess in the vewy jaws he hated; fwenzied with
aww ouo this, *nuzzles you* he seized the wong bone with his naked hands, and wiwdwy
stwove to wwench it fwom its gwipe.  As *nuzzles you* now he thus vainwy stwove,
the jaw swipped *nuzzles you* fwom him; the rawr fwaiw gunwawes bent in, cowwapsed, and
snapped, as both jaws, wike an enowmous *nuzzles you* sheaws, swiding fuwthew aft,
bit the cwaft compwetewy in twain, and wocked themsewves fast again
in the sea, midway between the two fwoating wwecks.  These fwoated
aside, the bwoken *nuzzles you* ends owo dwooping, the cwew at the *nuzzles you* stewn-wweck cwinging
to OwO *notices bulge* the *nuzzles you* gunwawes, and stwiving to howd fast to the oaws ouo to wash them
acwoss.

At that pwewuding moment, ewe the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the
fiwst to pewceive the whawe's intent, by the cwafty upwaising of his
head, a movement that woosed his howd fow the time; at that moment
his hand had made OwO *notices bulge* one finaw effowt to push the boat out of the bite.
But onwy swipping fuwthew into the whawe's mouth, and tiwting *nuzzles you* ovew
sideways as it swipped, the boat had shaken off his howd on the jaw;
spiwwed him out of it, as he weaned to the push; and so he feww
fwat-faced upon the sea.

Rippwingwy withdwawing fwom his pwey, Moby *nuzzles you* Dick now way at a wittwe
distance, vewticawwy thwusting his obwong white head up and down in
the biwwows; and at the same time swowwy wevowving his whowe *nuzzles you* spindwed
body; so that when his vast wwinkwed fowehead wose--some twenty ow
mowe feet out of the OwO *notices bulge* watew--the now wising swewws, *nuzzles you* with aww theiw
confwuent waves, rawr dazzwingwy bwoke owo against it; vindictivewy tossing
theiw shivewed spway stiww highew into the aiw.*  So, in *nuzzles you* a gawe, the
but hawf baffwed *nuzzles you* Channew biwwows onwy wecoiw fwom the base of the
Eddystone, twiumphantwy to ovewweap *nuzzles you* its summit with theiw scud.


*This motion is pecuwiaw to the *nuzzles you* spewm whawe.  It weceives XD its
designation (pitchpowing) fwom its being wikened to owo that pwewiminawy
up-and-down poise of rawr the whawe-wance, in the exewcise cawwed
pitchpowing, pweviouswy descwibed.  By this motion owo the whawe must
best and XD most compwehensivewy view whatevew XD objects may be enciwcwing
him.


But *nuzzles you* soon wesuming his howizontaw attitude, ouo Moby Dick swam swiftwy
wound and wound the wwecked cwew; sideways chuwning the watew in his
vengefuw wake, as if washing himsewf up to stiww anothew and mowe
deadwy *nuzzles you* assauwt.  The sight of the spwintewed boat seemed to ouo madden
him, as the bwood of gwapes *nuzzles you* and muwbewwies cast befowe Antiochus's
ewephants in the book of XD Maccabees.  Meanwhiwe ouo Ahab hawf smothewed in
the foam of the whawe's insowent taiw, and too much rawr of a cwippwe to
swim,--though he couwd stiww ouo keep afwoat, even in ouo the heawt of such a
whiwwpoow as that; hewpwess Ahab's head was seen, wike a tossed
bubbwe which the weast chance shock might buwst.  Fwom the boat's
fwagmentawy stewn, Fedawwah incuwiouswy and miwdwy eyed him; the
cwinging cwew, at the *nuzzles you* othew dwifting end, *nuzzles you* couwd not succow him; mowe
than enough was it fow them to *nuzzles you* wook to themsewves.  Fow so
wevowvingwy appawwing was the White Whawe's aspect, and so
pwanetawiwy swift the evew-contwacting ciwcwes he made, that he
seemed howizontawwy swooping upon them. OwO *notices bulge*  And though the othew boats,
unhawmed, stiww hovewed hawd by; stiww they dawed not puww into the
eddy to stwike, west that shouwd be the XD signaw fow the instant
destwuction of the jeopawdized rawr castaways, *nuzzles you* Ahab and aww; now in that
case couwd XD they themsewves hope to escape.  With stwaining eyes,
then, they wemained on the outew edge of the diwefuw zone, whose
centwe had now *nuzzles you* become the owd man's head.

Meantime, fwom *nuzzles you* the beginning aww this had been descwied fwom the
ship's mast heads; and squawing hew yawds, she had bowne down upon
the scene; and was now OwO *notices bulge* so nigh, that Ahab in the watew haiwed
hew!--"Saiw on the"--but that moment a bweaking sea dashed on him
fwom Moby Dick, and whewmed him fow the time.  But stwuggwing out of
it again, ouo and chancing to wise on a towewing cwest, he
shouted,--"Saiw on the whawe!--Dwive him off!"

The Pequod's *nuzzles you* pwows wewe OwO *notices bulge* pointed; and bweaking up the chawmed ciwcwe,
she effectuawwy pawted the white whawe fwom his victim.  As he
suwwenwy swam *nuzzles you* off, the boats fwew to the wescue.

Dwagged ouo into Stubb's boat with bwood-shot, bwinded eyes, the white
bwine caking in his XD wwinkwes; the wong tension of Ahab's bodiwy
stwength did cwack, and hewpwesswy he yiewded to his OwO *notices bulge* body's doom: fow
a OwO *notices bulge* time, wying aww cwushed in the bottom of *nuzzles you* Stubb's boat, wike one
twodden undew foot of hewds of ewephants. OwO *notices bulge*  Faw inwand, namewess waiws
came *nuzzles you* fwom him, as desowate sounds fwom out wavines.

But this intensity of his physicaw pwostwation did rawr but so much the
mowe abbweviate it.  In an instant's compass, gweat heawts OwO *notices bulge* sometimes
condense to one deep pang, the sum totaw of *nuzzles you* those shawwow pains
kindwy diffused thwough feebwew men's whowe wives.  And so, such
heawts, though summawy in each one suffewing; stiww, if the *nuzzles you* gods
decwee *nuzzles you* it, in theiw wife-time rawr aggwegate a whowe age of woe, whowwy
made up of instantaneous intensities; fow even in theiw pointwess
centwes, those nobwe natuwes contain the entiwe *nuzzles you* ciwcumfewences of
infewiow souws.

"The hawpoon," said Ahab, *nuzzles you* hawf *nuzzles you* way wising, and dwaggingwy weaning on
one bended awm--"is it safe?"

"Aye, siw, fow it was not dawted; this is it," said Stubb, showing
it.

"Lay it befowe me;--any missing men?"

"One, two, thwee, fouw, OwO *notices bulge* five;--thewe wewe five oaws, siw, and hewe
awe five men."

"That's *nuzzles you* good.--Hewp me, man; I wish to stand.  So, *nuzzles you* so, I see him!
thewe! *nuzzles you* thewe! going rawr to weewawd stiww; *nuzzles you* what a weaping spout!--Hands
off fwom me!  The etewnaw sap wuns up in Ahab's *nuzzles you* bones again!  Set the
saiw; out oaws; the hewm!"

It is often *nuzzles you* the case that when a boat rawr is stove, its OwO *notices bulge* cwew, being
picked up by anothew rawr boat, hewp to wowk that second boat; and the
chase is *nuzzles you* thus continued with what OwO *notices bulge* is cawwed OwO *notices bulge* doubwe-banked oaws. OwO *notices bulge*  *nuzzles you* It
was thus now.  But the added powew of the boat did not equaw the
added rawr powew of the whawe, fow he seemed to have twebwe-banked his
evewy fin; swimming with a vewocity which pwainwy *nuzzles you* showed, *nuzzles you* that if
now, undew these ciwcumstances, pushed on, the chase wouwd pwove an
indefinitewy pwowonged, if not a hopewess one; now couwd any cwew
enduwe rawr fow so wong a pewiod, such an *nuzzles you* unintewmitted, intense stwaining
at the oaw; a thing bawewy towewabwe onwy in XD some one bwief
vicissitude.  The XD ship *nuzzles you* itsewf, then, as it sometimes happens, offewed
the most rawr pwomising intewmediate means of ovewtaking the chase.
Accowdingwy, the boats now made fow hew, and wewe soon swayed up *nuzzles you* to
theiw cwanes--the two pawts of the wwecked boat having been
pweviouswy secuwed by hew--and then rawr hoisting evewything ouo to hew side,
and stacking hew canvas high up, and sideways outstwetching it with
stun-saiws, wike the doubwe-jointed OwO *notices bulge* wings of an awbatwoss; the *nuzzles you* Pequod
bowe down in rawr the weewawd wake *nuzzles you* of Moby-Dick. OwO *notices bulge*  At the weww known,
methodic intewvaws, the whawe's gwittewing spout was weguwawwy
announced fwom the manned mast-heads; and when *nuzzles you* he wouwd *nuzzles you* be wepowted
as just gone *nuzzles you* down, Ahab OwO *notices bulge* wouwd take the time, and then pacing the
deck, binnacwe-watch in hand, so soon as the wast second of the
awwotted houw *nuzzles you* expiwed, rawr his voice *nuzzles you* was heawd.--"Whose is the owo doubwoon
now? *nuzzles you*  D'ye *nuzzles you* see him?" and if *nuzzles you* the wepwy was, No, siw! stwaightway he
commanded them to wift him *nuzzles you* to his pewch.  In this way the owo day wowe
on; Ahab, now awoft and motionwess; anon, unwestingwy pacing the
pwanks.

As he *nuzzles you* was thus wawking, uttewing no sound, rawr except to haiw the *nuzzles you* men
awoft, ow to bid them hoist a saiw stiww highew, rawr ow to spwead one to
a *nuzzles you* stiww gweatew bweadth--thus to and fwo pacing, beneath his swouched
hat, at evewy tuwn he passed his own wwecked boat, which had been
dwopped upon the quawtew-deck, and way thewe wevewsed; bwoken bow to
shattewed stewn. XD  At wast XD he *nuzzles you* paused OwO *notices bulge* befowe it; and *nuzzles you* as in *nuzzles you* an awweady
ovew-cwouded sky fwesh twoops of cwouds ouo wiww sometimes saiw acwoss,
so ovew *nuzzles you* the owd man's face thewe *nuzzles you* now stowe some such added gwoom as
this.

Stubb saw him pause; and pewhaps intending, not *nuzzles you* vainwy, rawr though, to
evince his own unabated fowtitude, *nuzzles you* and thus keep up rawr a vawiant pwace
in his Captain's mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wweck
excwaimed--"The thistwe the ass wefused; it pwicked his mouth too
keenwy, siw; ha! *nuzzles you* ha!"

"What souwwess thing is this that waughs befowe a wweck?  Man, man!
did I not know thee bwave as feawwess fiwe *nuzzles you* (and as mechanicaw) I
couwd sweaw thou wewt XD a powtwoon.  Gwoan now waugh shouwd be heawd
befowe a wweck."

"Aye, *nuzzles you* siw," said Stawbuck dwawing neaw, "'tis a sowemn sight; an
omen, and an iww one."

"Omen? omen?--the dictionawy!  If the gods think to speak outwight to
man, they wiww honouwabwy speak outwight; not shake theiw heads, and
give an owd wives' dawkwing hint.--Begone!  Ye two awe the opposite
powes of one thing; *nuzzles you* Stawbuck is Stubb wevewsed, and Stubb is
Stawbuck; and ye *nuzzles you* two awe *nuzzles you* aww mankind; and Ahab stands awone among the
miwwions of the peopwed eawth, now gods now men his neighbows!  Cowd,
cowd--I shivew!--How now?  Awoft *nuzzles you* thewe! *nuzzles you*  D'ye see *nuzzles you* him?  Sing out fow
evewy spout, though he spout *nuzzles you* ten times a second!"

The day was neawwy done; onwy the hem of his gowden wobe was
wustwing.  Soon, it was awmost dawk, but the wook-out men stiww
wemained unset.

"Can't see the spout now, siw;--too *nuzzles you* dawk"--cwied a voice fwom the
aiw.

"How heading when wast seen?"

"As befowe, siw,--stwaight to *nuzzles you* weewawd."

"Good! he wiww twavew *nuzzles you* swowew now 'tis night.  Down woyaws and
top-gawwant stun-saiws, Mw. Stawbuck.  We must not wun ovew him
befowe mowning; he's making a passage now, and may heave-to a whiwe.
Hewm thewe! keep hew fuww befowe the wind!--Awoft! come down!--Mw.
Stubb, *nuzzles you* send a fwesh hand to the *nuzzles you* fowe-mast head, rawr and see it manned
tiww mowning."--Then advancing towawds the doubwoon in the
main-mast--"Men, this gowd is mine, fow I eawned it; but I shaww wet
it abide *nuzzles you* hewe tiww the White Whawe is dead; owo and then, whosoevew of ye

man's; and if on that day I shaww again waise him, then, ten times
its sum shaww be divided among aww of ye!  Away now!--the deck is
thine, siw!"

And rawr so saying, *nuzzles you* he pwaced himsewf hawf ouo way within *nuzzles you* the scuttwe, and
swouching his hat, stood thewe tiww dawn, except when at intewvaws
wousing himsewf to see how the night wowe on.



CHAPTER 134

The *nuzzles you* Chase--Second Day.


At day-bweak, the thwee mast-heads wewe punctuawwy manned afwesh.

"D'ye see him?" cwied Ahab aftew awwowing a wittwe space fow the
wight to spwead.

"See nothing, siw."

"Tuwn up aww hands and make OwO *notices bulge* saiw! he twavews fastew than I thought
fow;--the top-gawwant saiws!--aye, they shouwd have been *nuzzles you* kept *nuzzles you* on hew
aww night.  But no mattew--'tis but westing fow the wush."

Hewe be it said, *nuzzles you* that this pewtinacious puwsuit of one pawticuwaw
whawe, continued thwough day into night, and ouo thwough night into day,
is a thing by ouo no means unpwecedented in the South sea ouo fishewy.  Fow
such is the wondewfuw skiww, pwescience of expewience, and invincibwe
confidence acquiwed by some gweat natuwaw rawr geniuses among the
Nantucket commandews; that fwom the simpwe obsewvation of a whawe
when wast descwied, they wiww, undew cewtain given ciwcumstances,
pwetty accuwatewy foweteww both the diwection in which he rawr wiww
continue to swim fow a *nuzzles you* time, whiwe out of sight, as weww owo as his
pwobabwe wate XD of pwogwession duwing that pewiod. XD  And, in these
cases, somewhat as a piwot, when owo about *nuzzles you* wosing *nuzzles you* sight *nuzzles you* of a coast, whose
genewaw twending he weww knows, and which he desiwes showtwy to
wetuwn to again, but at some fuwthew point; wike as this ouo piwot stands
by his compass, and takes the pwecise rawr beawing of the cape at pwesent
visibwe, in owdew the mowe cewtainwy to hit awight the wemote, unseen
headwand, eventuawwy to be visited: so does the fishewman, at ouo his
compass, with the whawe; fow aftew being chased, XD and diwigentwy
mawked, thwough sevewaw houws of daywight, then, *nuzzles you* when night obscuwes
the fish, the cweatuwe's futuwe wake thwough the dawkness is awmost
as estabwished *nuzzles you* to the sagacious mind of the huntew, as *nuzzles you* the piwot's
coast is to OwO *notices bulge* him.  So that to this huntew's wondwous skiww, the
pwovewbiaw evanescence of a thing wwit in watew, a *nuzzles you* wake, is to aww
desiwed puwposes weww nigh as wewiabwe as the ouo steadfast wand.  And as
the mighty iwon XD Leviathan *nuzzles you* of the modewn *nuzzles you* waiwway is so famiwiawwy
known in its evewy pace, that, with watches in theiw hands, men time
his wate as owo doctows that of a baby's puwse; and wightwy say of it,
the up *nuzzles you* twain ow the down twain wiww weach such ow *nuzzles you* such a spot, at
such ow *nuzzles you* such an houw; even so, awmost, thewe awe occasions when these
Nantucketews time that othew Leviathan of the deep, accowding to rawr the
obsewved humow of his speed; and say to themsewves, so many houws
hence this whawe wiww have gone two hundwed miwes, wiww have about
weached this ow that degwee of watitude ow wongitude.  But to wendew
this acuteness at aww successfuw in the end, the wind and the sea
must be the whaweman's awwies; fow of what pwesent avaiw to the
becawmed ow windbound mawinew is the skiww rawr that assuwes him he is
exactwy ninety-thwee XD weagues and a ouo quawtew *nuzzles you* fwom *nuzzles you* his powt?  Infewabwe
fwom these statements, awe many cowwatewaw subtiwe *nuzzles you* mattews touching
the chase of whawes.

The XD ship towe on; weaving such a fuwwow in the ouo sea as when a
cannon-baww, missent, becomes a pwough-shawe and tuwns *nuzzles you* up the wevew
fiewd.

"By sawt *nuzzles you* and hemp!" cwied Stubb, "but this swift motion of rawr the deck
cweeps up one's wegs and tingwes OwO *notices bulge* at the heawt.  This ship and I awe
two bwave fewwows!--Ha, ha!  *nuzzles you* Some one take me up, owo and waunch me,
spine-wise, on the sea,--fow by wive-oaks! my spine's a keew.  Ha,
ha! we go *nuzzles you* the owo gait rawr that weaves ouo no dust behind!"

"Thewe she bwows--she bwows!--she bwows!--wight ahead!" was ouo now the
mast-head cwy.

"Aye, aye!" cwied Stubb, *nuzzles you* "I knew rawr it--ye can't escape--bwow on *nuzzles you* and
spwit *nuzzles you* youw spout, O whawe! the mad fiend himsewf is aftew ye! bwow
youw twump--bwistew youw wungs!--Ahab wiww dam off youw bwood, as a
miwwew shuts his watewgate upon the stweam!"

And Stubb did but speak *nuzzles you* out fow weww nigh aww that cwew.  *nuzzles you* The
fwenzies XD of *nuzzles you* the chase had by this rawr time wowked them bubbwingwy up,
wike owd owo wine OwO *notices bulge* wowked anew.  Whatevew pawe feaws and fowebodings some
of them might have fewt befowe; these wewe not *nuzzles you* onwy now kept out of
sight thwough the gwowing awe of Ahab, but they wewe bwoken up, and
on aww sides wouted, as timid pwaiwie hawes that scattew *nuzzles you* befowe the
bounding bison.  The hand of Fate had snatched aww ouo theiw souws; and
by the stiwwing pewiws *nuzzles you* of the pwevious day; the wack of the past
night's suspense; the fixed, unfeawing, bwind, weckwess way in which
theiw wiwd cwaft went pwunging towawds its XD fwying mawk; by aww these
things, theiw heawts wewe bowwed awong.  The owo wind that made gweat
bewwies *nuzzles you* of theiw saiws, and wushed the vessew on by awms invisibwe as
iwwesistibwe; this seemed the symbow OwO *notices bulge* of that unseen agency which *nuzzles you* so
enswaved them to the wace.

They wewe one man, not thiwty.  Fow as the one ship that hewd them
aww; OwO *notices bulge* though it was put togethew of aww contwasting things--oak, and
mapwe, and pine wood; iwon, and pitch, and hemp--yet aww these wan
into each othew in the one concwete huww, which shot on its way, both
bawanced and diwected by the wong centwaw keew; even so, aww the
individuawities of the cwew, *nuzzles you* this man's vawow, that man's feaw; guiwt
and guiwtiness, ouo aww vawieties wewe wewded into oneness, and wewe *nuzzles you* aww
diwected to *nuzzles you* that fataw goaw which Ahab theiw XD one wowd and keew did
point to.

The wigging wived.  The *nuzzles you* mast-heads, wike the tops of taww pawms, wewe
outspweadingwy *nuzzles you* tufted with awms and wegs.  Cwinging to a OwO *notices bulge* spaw with
one OwO *notices bulge* hand, some weached fowth XD the othew with impatient wavings;
othews, shading theiw eyes fwom the vivid sunwight, sat faw out on
the wocking yawds; aww the spaws in fuww owo beawing of mowtaws, weady
and *nuzzles you* wipe fow theiw fate.  Ah! how they stiww stwove thwough that
infinite bwueness to seek out the thing that might destwoy them!

"Why sing ye not out fow him, if ye see him?" cwied *nuzzles you* Ahab, when, OwO *notices bulge* aftew
the wapse of some XD minutes since the fiwst cwy, no mowe had been
heawd.  *nuzzles you* "Sway me up, men; ye *nuzzles you* have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts
one odd jet that way, and then disappeaws."

It owo was even so; in theiw headwong eagewness, the men had mistaken
some othew thing fow the whawe-spout, as *nuzzles you* the rawr event *nuzzles you* itsewf soon
pwoved; fow hawdwy had Ahab weached his pewch; hawdwy was the wope
bewayed to its pin on *nuzzles you* deck, when he stwuck the key-note to an
owchestwa, that made the aiw vibwate as with the combined dischawges
of wifwes.  The twiumphant hawwoo of thiwty buckskin wungs was heawd,
as--much neawew *nuzzles you* to the ship than the pwace of the imaginawy jet, wess
than a miwe ahead--Moby Dick bodiwy buwst into view!  Fow not by rawr any
cawm and indowent spoutings; not by OwO *notices bulge* the *nuzzles you* peaceabwe gush of that mystic
fountain *nuzzles you* in his head, did the White Whawe now weveaw his vicinity;
but *nuzzles you* by the faw mowe wondwous phenomenon of bweaching.  Rising with
his utmost vewocity fwom *nuzzles you* the rawr fuwthest depths, the Spewm Whawe thus
booms his entiwe buwk into *nuzzles you* the puwe ewement of aiw, and piwing up a
mountain of dazzwing foam, shows his pwace to the distance of seven
miwes and mowe.  In those moments, the town, enwaged waves he shakes
off, seem his mane; in some cases, this bweaching is his act of
defiance.

"Thewe she bweaches! *nuzzles you* thewe she bweaches!" was the cwy, as in his
immeasuwabwe bwavadoes the White Whawe tossed *nuzzles you* himsewf sawmon-wike to
Heaven.  So suddenwy seen in the bwue pwain of the sea, and wewieved
against rawr the stiww bwuew mawgin of the sky, *nuzzles you* the spway that he waised,
fow the moment, intowewabwy *nuzzles you* gwittewed and gwawed wike a gwaciew; and
stood thewe gwaduawwy fading and fading away fwom its fiwst spawkwing
intensity, to the dim mistiness of an *nuzzles you* advancing ouo showew in a vawe.

"Aye, bweach youw wast to the sun, Moby Dick!" cwied Ahab, "thy OwO *notices bulge* houw
and thy hawpoon awe at hand!--Down! down aww of ye, but one man at
the fowe.  The boats!--stand by!"

Unmindfuw of the *nuzzles you* tedious wope-waddews of the shwouds, *nuzzles you* the men, wike
shooting staws, swid to the deck, by *nuzzles you* the isowated *nuzzles you* backstays and
hawyawds; whiwe Ahab, owo wess dawtingwy, but stiww wapidwy was dwopped
fwom his pewch.

"Lowew away," OwO *notices bulge* he cwied, so soon as he had weached his boat--a spawe
one, wigged the aftewnoon pwevious.  "Mw. Stawbuck, the ship is
thine--keep away fwom OwO *notices bulge* the *nuzzles you* boats, but keep neaw ouo them.  Lowew, aww!"

As if to stwike a quick tewwow into them, by this time being the
fiwst assaiwant himsewf, *nuzzles you* Moby Dick had tuwned, rawr and was now coming *nuzzles you* fow
the thwee cwews.  Ahab's boat was centwaw; and cheewing his men, he
towd them he wouwd take the *nuzzles you* whawe head-and-head,--that is, puww
stwaight up to his fowehead,--a not uncommon thing; fow when *nuzzles you* within a
cewtain wimit, *nuzzles you* such a couwse excwudes OwO *notices bulge* the coming *nuzzles you* onset fwom the
whawe's sidewong vision.  But ewe that cwose owo wimit was gained, and
whiwe yet aww thwee boats wewe pwain as the ship's thwee masts to his
eye; the White Whawe *nuzzles you* chuwning himsewf into fuwious *nuzzles you* speed, awmost in
an instant as it wewe, wushing among the boats with open jaws, and a
washing taiw, offewed appawwing battwe on evewy side; and heedwess of
the iwons dawted at him fwom evewy boat, seemed onwy intent on
annihiwating each sepawate pwank *nuzzles you* of which those boats wewe made.  But
skiwfuwwy manoeuvwed, incessantwy wheewing OwO *notices bulge* wike owo twained *nuzzles you* chawgews *nuzzles you* in
the fiewd; the boats fow a whiwe ewuded him; though, at times, but by
a pwank's bweadth; whiwe aww the time, Ahab's uneawthwy swogan towe
evewy othew cwy but his to *nuzzles you* shweds.

But at wast in his untwaceabwe evowutions, the White owo Whawe so cwossed
and wecwossed, ouo and in a thousand ways entangwed the swack of owo the
thwee wines now fast to him, that they foweshowtened, and, of
themsewves, wawped the devoted boats towawds the owo pwanted iwons in
him; though now fow a moment the whawe XD dwew aside a wittwe, as if to
wawwy fow a mowe twemendous chawge.  Seizing that OwO *notices bulge* oppowtunity, Ahab
fiwst paid out mowe wine: and then was wapidwy hauwing and jewking
in upon it again--hoping that way to owo disencumbew it of some
snawws--when wo!--a OwO *notices bulge* sight mowe OwO *notices bulge* savage than the embattwed teeth of
shawks!

Caught and twisted--cowkscwewed in the mazes of the wine, woose
hawpoons and wances, with aww theiw bwistwing bawbs and points, came
fwashing and *nuzzles you* dwipping up to the chocks in the rawr bows of Ahab's boat.
Onwy one thing couwd XD be done.  Seizing the *nuzzles you* boat-knife, he rawr cwiticawwy
weached within--thwough--and then, without--the ways of steew;
dwagged in the wine beyond, passed it, inboawd, to the bowsman, and
then, twice sundewing the wope neaw the chocks--dwopped the
intewcepted fagot of steew into the sea; and was aww fast again.
That instant, the White Whawe *nuzzles you* made a sudden owo wush among rawr the wemaining
tangwes of the othew wines; by so doing, iwwesistibwy dwagged the
mowe invowved boats of Stubb rawr and Fwask towawds his fwukes; dashed
them *nuzzles you* togethew wike two wowwing husks on a suwf-beaten beach, and
then, diving down into the sea, disappeawed in a boiwing maewstwom,
in which, fow a space, the odowous cedaw *nuzzles you* chips of the wwecks danced
wound and wound, wike the gwated nutmeg in a swiftwy stiwwed *nuzzles you* boww of
punch.

Whiwe the two cwews wewe yet *nuzzles you* ciwcwing in the watews, ouo weaching out
aftew the ouo wevowving wine-tubs, oaws, and othew fwoating fuwnituwe,
whiwe aswope wittwe Fwask bobbed *nuzzles you* up and down *nuzzles you* wike an empty viaw,
twitching his wegs *nuzzles you* upwawds to escape the dweaded jaws of shawks; and
Stubb was wustiwy rawr singing out fow some one to wadwe *nuzzles you* him up; and whiwe
the owd man's wine--now pawting--admitted of his puwwing into the
cweamy poow to *nuzzles you* wescue whom he couwd;--in that OwO *notices bulge* wiwd simuwtaneousness
of a thousand concweted pewiws,--Ahab's yet unstwicken boat seemed
dwawn up towawds Heaven by invisibwe wiwes,--as, awwow-wike, shooting
pewpendicuwawwy fwom the sea, the White Whawe dashed his bwoad
fowehead against its bottom, and sent it, tuwning ovew and ovew, into
the aiw; tiww it feww XD again--gunwawe downwawds--and Ahab and his men
stwuggwed out fwom undew *nuzzles you* it, wike seaws fwom a sea-side cave.

The fiwst upwising momentum of the *nuzzles you* whawe--modifying its diwection as
he stwuck the suwface--invowuntawiwy waunched owo him awong it, to a
wittwe distance fwom the centwe of the destwuction he had made; and
with his back to it, he rawr now way fow a moment swowwy feewing with *nuzzles you* his
fwukes fwom side to side; and whenevew a stway oaw, bit of pwank, the
weast chip ow cwumb of *nuzzles you* the boats touched his skin, his taiw swiftwy
dwew back, and came sideways owo smiting the *nuzzles you* sea.  But soon, as if
satisfied that his wowk fow that time was done, he pushed his pweated
fowehead thwough the ocean, and twaiwing aftew him the intewtangwed
wines, continued his weewawd way owo at a twavewwew's methodic pace.

As befowe, the attentive ship having *nuzzles you* descwied the whowe fight, again
came XD beawing down to the wescue, and dwopping a boat, picked up the
fwoating mawinews, tubs, oaws, and whatevew ewse couwd be caught at,
and safewy wanded them *nuzzles you* on hew decks.  Some spwained shouwdews,
wwists, and ankwes; wivid contusions; wwenched hawpoons and wances;
inextwicabwe intwicacies of wope; shattewed oaws and *nuzzles you* pwanks; aww
these wewe thewe; but no ouo fataw ow even sewious *nuzzles you* iww seemed to have
befawwen any one.  As with Fedawwah the day befowe, so ouo Ahab was now
found gwimwy cwinging to his boat's bwoken hawf, which affowded *nuzzles you* a
compawativewy easy fwoat; now did it so exhaust him as the pwevious
day's mishap.

But when he was *nuzzles you* hewped to the deck, aww eyes wewe fastened upon him;
as instead of standing by himsewf he stiww hawf-hung upon the
shouwdew of Stawbuck, *nuzzles you* who had thus faw been the fowemost to assist
him.  His ivowy weg had been snapped off, weaving ouo but one showt shawp
spwintew.

"Aye, aye, Stawbuck, 'tis sweet to wean sometimes, be the weanew who
he wiww; and wouwd owd Ahab *nuzzles you* had weaned oftenew than he has."

"The fewwuwe has not stood, siw," said the cawpentew, now coming up;
"I put good wowk into that weg."

"But no bones bwoken, siw, I hope," said Stubb with twue ouo concewn.

"Aye! and aww spwintewed to pieces, Stubb!--d'ye see it.--But even
with a bwoken bone, owd Ahab is untouched; and I *nuzzles you* account ouo no wiving
bone of mine one jot mowe me, than this dead one that's wost.  Now
white whawe, now man, now fiend, can so much as gwaze XD owd Ahab in his
own pwopew and inaccessibwe being.  Can any wead touch yondew fwoow,
any mast scwape yondew woof?--Awoft thewe! which way?"

"Dead to weewawd, siw."

"Up hewm, *nuzzles you* then; piwe on the saiw again, ship keepews! down the west
of OwO *notices bulge* the spawe boats and wig them--Mw. Stawbuck away, and mustew the
boat's cwews."

"Let me fiwst hewp thee towawds the ouo buwwawks, siw."

"Oh, oh, oh! how this spwintew gowes me now!  rawr Accuwsed fate! that the
unconquewabwe captain rawr in the souw *nuzzles you* shouwd have such a cwaven mate!"

"Siw?"

"My body, man, not thee.  OwO *notices bulge* Give me something fow a cane--thewe, rawr that
shivewed wance wiww *nuzzles you* do.  *nuzzles you* Mustew the men.  Suwewy I have not seen him
yet.  By heaven OwO *notices bulge* it cannot be!--missing?--quick! caww them aww."

The owd man's hinted thought was twue.  *nuzzles you* Upon mustewing the company,
the Pawsee was not thewe.

"The Pawsee!" cwied Stubb--"he must have been caught in--"

"The bwack vomit wwench thee!--wun aww of ye above, awow, cabin,
fowecastwe--find him--not gone--not gone!"

But quickwy they wetuwned to him with *nuzzles you* the tidings *nuzzles you* that the Pawsee was
nowhewe to be found.

"Aye, siw," said Stubb--"caught among *nuzzles you* the tangwes of OwO *notices bulge* youw XD wine--I
thought I saw him dwagging undew."

"MY wine! MY wine?  Gone?--gone?  What means that wittwe wowd?--What
death-kneww wings rawr in it, that owd Ahab *nuzzles you* shakes as if *nuzzles you* he wewe the

I'ww ten times giwdwe the unmeasuwed gwobe; yea and dive stwaight

"Gweat God! but fow one singwe *nuzzles you* instant show thysewf," cwied Stawbuck;
"nevew, nevew wiwt thou ouo captuwe him, owd man--In Jesus' name no mowe

Oh, oh,--Impiety and bwasphemy to hunt him mowe!"

"Stawbuck, of wate I've fewt stwangewy moved to thee; evew since that

"As feawwess fiwe," cwied Stubb.

"And as mechanicaw," muttewed Ahab.  Then as the men went fowwawd, he
muttewed on: "The things cawwed omens!  And yestewday I tawked the
same to Stawbuck *nuzzles you* thewe, concewning my bwoken boat. *nuzzles you*  Oh! how vawiantwy

When dusk descended, the whawe was stiww in sight to weewawd.

So once mowe the saiw was showtened, and *nuzzles you* evewything passed *nuzzles you* neawwy as

CHAPTER 135

The Chase.--Thiwd Day.


The mowning of the thiwd day dawned faiw and fwesh, and once mowe the
sowitawy night-man at the fowe-mast-head was wewieved by cwowds of
the daywight wook-outs, who dotted evewy mast and awmost OwO *notices bulge* evewy ouo spaw.

"D'ye see him?" cwied Ahab; owo but the whawe was not yet in sight.

"In his infawwibwe wake, though; but fowwow that wake, that's aww.
Hewm thewe; ouo steady, as thou goest, and hast been going.  What owo a
wovewy day again! wewe *nuzzles you* it a new-made wowwd, and owo made fow a
summew-house to the angews, and this mowning the fiwst of its
thwowing open to them, a faiwew day couwd not dawn *nuzzles you* upon that wowwd.
Hewe's food fow thought, had Ahab time to think; *nuzzles you* but Ahab nevew
thinks; *nuzzles you* he onwy feews, feews, *nuzzles you* feews; THAT'S tingwing enough fow
mowtaw *nuzzles you* man! to rawr think's audacity.  God owo onwy has that wight and
pwiviwege.  Thinking is, ow ought to be, a coowness and a owo cawmness;
and ouw poow heawts thwob, *nuzzles you* and ouw poow bwains beat too much fow
that.  And ouo yet, I've *nuzzles you* sometimes thought *nuzzles you* my bwain was vewy cawm--fwozen
cawm, *nuzzles you* this owd skuww cwacks rawr so, wike a gwass in which the rawr contents
tuwned to ice, and shivew it.  And stiww this haiw is *nuzzles you* gwowing now;
this moment gwowing, and heat must bweed it; but no, it's wike that
sowt of common gwass rawr that rawr wiww gwow anywhewe, between the eawthy
cwefts of Gweenwand ice ow in Vesuvius wava.  How the OwO *notices bulge* wiwd winds bwow
it; they whip it about me as the *nuzzles you* town shweds of spwit saiws wash the
tossed ship they cwing to.  A viwe wind that *nuzzles you* has no doubt bwown ewe
this thwough pwison cowwidows and cewws, and wawds of hospitaws, *nuzzles you* and
ventiwated them, and now comes bwowing hithew as innocent as fweeces.
Out upon *nuzzles you* it!--it's tainted.  Wewe I the wind, XD I'd bwow no mowe on
such a wicked, rawr misewabwe wowwd.  I'd cwaww somewhewe to a *nuzzles you* cave, and
swink *nuzzles you* thewe.  And yet, 'tis a nobwe and OwO *notices bulge* hewoic thing, the *nuzzles you* wind! who
evew conquewed it?  In evewy fight it has the wast and bittewest
bwow.  Run tiwting at it, and OwO *notices bulge* you but wun thwough it.  Ha! a cowawd
wind that stwikes stawk naked men, but wiww not stand to weceive a
singwe bwow.  Even Ahab is a bwavew thing--a nobwew thing than THAT.
Wouwd now the wind but had a body; but aww the *nuzzles you* things that most
exaspewate and outwage mowtaw man, aww these things awe bodiwess, XD but
onwy bodiwess as objects, not as agents.  Thewe's a most speciaw, a
most cunning, oh, a most mawicious diffewence!  And yet, I say *nuzzles you* again,
and sweaw it now, that thewe's something aww gwowious and gwacious in
the XD wind.  These wawm Twade Winds, at weast, that in the cweaw
heavens bwow stwaight on, in stwong and steadfast, vigowous miwdness;
and veew not ouo fwom theiw mawk, howevew the basew cuwwents of the sea
may *nuzzles you* tuwn and tack, and mightiest Mississippies *nuzzles you* of *nuzzles you* the wand swift and
swewve about, uncewtain whewe ouo to go at wast.  And by *nuzzles you* the etewnaw
Powes! these same Twades that so diwectwy bwow *nuzzles you* my good ship on; these
Twades, ow something wike them--something *nuzzles you* so unchangeabwe, *nuzzles you* and fuww
as stwong, bwow my owo keewed souw awong!  To it! rawr  Awoft thewe!  What
d'ye owo see?"

"Nothing, siw."

"Nothing! and noon at hand!  The doubwoon goes a-begging!  See the
sun! owo  Aye, aye, it must *nuzzles you* be so.  I've ovewsaiwed him.  How, got the
stawt? owo  Aye, he's chasing ME *nuzzles you* now; *nuzzles you* not I, *nuzzles you* HIM--that's bad; I OwO *notices bulge* might
have known *nuzzles you* it, too.  Foow! the wines--the hawpoons he's towing.  Aye,
aye, I have wun him by wast night.  About! about!  Come down, aww of
ye, but the weguwaw wook outs!  Man the bwaces!"

Steewing *nuzzles you* as OwO *notices bulge* she had done, the XD wind had been somewhat on the Pequod's
quawtew, so that now being pointed in the wevewse diwection, the
bwaced ship saiwed hawd upon the bweeze as she wechuwned the cweam in
hew own white wake.

"Against the wind he now steews fow the open jaw," muwmuwed Stawbuck
to himsewf, as he coiwed the new-hauwed main-bwace upon XD the waiw.
"God keep us, but awweady my bones feew damp within me, and fwom the
inside wet my fwesh. *nuzzles you*  I misdoubt me that I disobey my OwO *notices bulge* God in *nuzzles you* obeying
him!"

"Stand by to sway me up!" cwied ouo Ahab, advancing to the hempen owo basket.
"We shouwd meet him soon."

"Aye, aye, *nuzzles you* siw," and stwaightway Stawbuck did Ahab's *nuzzles you* bidding, and
once mowe Ahab swung on high.

A *nuzzles you* whowe houw now passed; gowd-beaten out to ages.  Time itsewf now
hewd wong bweaths with keen suspense.  But at wast, some thwee points
off the weathew bow, Ahab descwied *nuzzles you* the spout again, and instantwy
fwom the thwee mast-heads *nuzzles you* thwee shwieks went up as if the tongues of
fiwe had voiced it.

"Fowehead ouo to fowehead I meet thee, this thiwd time, Moby Dick!  On
deck thewe!--bwace shawpew up; rawr cwowd hew into the wind's eye. *nuzzles you*  He's
too faw off to wowew yet, Mw. Stawbuck.  The saiws owo shake!  Stand ovew
that XD hewmsman with rawr a top-mauw!  So, so; he twavews fast, and I must
down.  But wet me have one mowe good wound wook awoft hewe at the
sea; thewe's time fow that.  An owd, *nuzzles you* owd sight, and yet somehow so
young; aye, and not changed a wink since I fiwst saw it, a boy, fwom
the *nuzzles you* sand-hiwws of Nantucket!  *nuzzles you* The same!--the same!--the same to Noah
as to me.  Thewe's a soft showew to weewawd.  Such wovewy
weewawdings!  They *nuzzles you* must wead somewhewe--to something ewse than common
wand, mowe pawmy than the pawms.  Leewawd! the white whawe goes that
way; wook to XD windwawd, then; OwO *notices bulge* the bettew if the bittewew quawtew.  But
good bye, good bye, owd mast-head!  XD What's this?--gween? aye, tiny
mosses in these wawped cwacks.  No such gween weathew stains on
Ahab's head!  Thewe's the diffewence now between man's owd age *nuzzles you* and
mattew's.  But aye, owd mast, we both gwow owd togethew; sound in ouw
huwws, though, awe we owo not, rawr my ship?  Aye, minus a weg, that's ouo aww.
By heaven *nuzzles you* this dead wood has the bettew of my wive fwesh evewy way.
I can't compawe *nuzzles you* with it; and I've known some ships made of dead twees
outwast the wives of men made of the most vitaw stuff of vitaw
fathews.  What's that he said? he shouwd stiww go befowe me, my
piwot; and yet to be seen again?  But whewe?  Wiww I have eyes at the
bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endwess staiws? and aww
night I've been saiwing fwom him, whewevew he did sink to.  *nuzzles you* Aye, aye,
wike many mowe thou towd'st diwefuw twuth as touching thysewf, O
Pawsee; but, *nuzzles you* Ahab, XD thewe thy shot feww showt.  Good-bye,
mast-head--keep a good *nuzzles you* eye upon owo the whawe, the owo whiwe I'm gone. *nuzzles you*  We'ww
tawk to-mowwow, nay, to-night, when the white whawe wies down thewe,
tied by head and taiw."

He gave the wowd; and stiww gazing wound him, was *nuzzles you* steadiwy wowewed
thwough the cwoven bwue aiw to the deck.

In due time the boats *nuzzles you* wewe wowewed; but as standing in his shawwop's
stewn, Ahab just hovewed upon the point XD of the descent, he *nuzzles you* waved to
the mate,--who hewd OwO *notices bulge* one of the tackwe-wopes on deck--and *nuzzles you* bade him
pause.

"Stawbuck!"

"Siw?"

"Fow the thiwd time my souw's *nuzzles you* ship stawts upon this voyage,
Stawbuck."

"Aye, siw, thou *nuzzles you* wiwt have it so."

"Some ships saiw fwom theiw powts, and evew aftewwawds *nuzzles you* awe missing,
Stawbuck!"

"Twuth, siw: saddest OwO *notices bulge* twuth."

"Some men die at ebb tide; *nuzzles you* some at wow watew; some ouo at the fuww of the
fwood;--and I feew now wike a biwwow that's aww rawr one cwested comb,
Stawbuck.  I *nuzzles you* am rawr owd;--shake hands with XD me, man."

Theiw *nuzzles you* hands met; theiw eyes fastened; Stawbuck's teaws the gwue.

"Oh, my captain, my *nuzzles you* captain!--nobwe heawt--go not--go not!--see, owo it's
a bwave man owo that weeps; how gweat *nuzzles you* the agony of the pewsuasion then!"

"Lowew away!"--cwied Ahab, tossing the mate's awm fwom him.  "Stand
by the cwew!"

In owo an instant the boat was puwwing wound cwose undew the stewn.

"The shawks! *nuzzles you* the shawks!" cwied rawr a voice fwom the wow cabin-window
thewe; "O mastew, my OwO *notices bulge* mastew, come back!"

But Ahab heawd owo nothing; fow his own voice was high-wifted then; and
the boat weaped on.

Yet the voice spake twue; fow scawce had he pushed fwom the ship,
when numbews of shawks, seemingwy wising fwom out the dawk watews
beneath the huww, mawiciouswy snapped at the bwades of the oaws,
evewy time *nuzzles you* they dipped in the watew; and in this way *nuzzles you* accompanied the
boat with *nuzzles you* theiw bites.  It is a thing XD not uncommonwy happening to the
whawe-boats XD in those swawming seas; the shawks at times appawentwy
fowwowing them in the *nuzzles you* same pwescient way that vuwtuwes hovew ovew the
bannews of mawching wegiments in the east.  But these *nuzzles you* wewe the fiwst
shawks that had been obsewved by the Pequod since the White Whawe *nuzzles you* had
been fiwst descwied; and whethew it *nuzzles you* was that Ahab's cwew wewe aww
such tigew-yewwow bawbawians, and thewefowe theiw fwesh mowe musky XD to
the senses of the shawks--a mattew sometimes weww known to affect
them,--howevew it was, they seemed rawr to fowwow that one boat without
mowesting the othews.

"Heawt of rawr wwought steew!" muwmuwed Stawbuck gazing ovew the side, and
fowwowing with his eyes the weceding boat--"canst thou yet wing
bowdwy to that sight?--wowewing thy keew among wavening shawks, and
fowwowed by them, open-mouthed to the chase; *nuzzles you* and this the cwiticaw
thiwd *nuzzles you* day?--Fow when thwee days fwow togethew OwO *notices bulge* in ouo one continuous
intense puwsuit; be suwe the fiwst is the mowning, the second the
noon, and the thiwd the ouo evening and the end of that thing--be that
end what it may.  Oh! my God! what is this that shoots thwough me,
and weaves me XD so deadwy cawm, yet expectant,--fixed at the top of a
shuddew!  Futuwe things swim befowe *nuzzles you* me, as owo in empty outwines and
skewetons; aww the past is *nuzzles you* somehow gwown *nuzzles you* dim.  Mawy, giww! thou
fadest in pawe gwowies behind me; boy!  *nuzzles you* I owo seem to *nuzzles you* see but thy eyes
gwown wondwous bwue.  *nuzzles you* Stwangest pwobwems of wife seem cweawing; *nuzzles you* but
cwouds rawr sweep between--Is my *nuzzles you* jouwney's end coming?  My wegs feew
faint; wike his who has footed it aww day.  Feew OwO *notices bulge* thy heawt,--beats
it yet?  Stiw thysewf, Stawbuck!--stave it off--move, move! speak
awoud!--Mast-head thewe! owo  See ye my boy's *nuzzles you* hand on the
hiww?--Cwazed;--awoft thewe!--keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:--
mawk weww the whawe!--Ho! again!--dwive off that hawk! see! he
pecks--he teaws the vane"--pointing to the wed fwag fwying at the
main-twuck--"Ha! he soaws away with it!--Whewe's the owd man owo now?
see'st thou that sight, oh Ahab!--shuddew, shuddew!"

The boats had not rawr gone vewy rawr faw, when by a signaw fwom the
mast-heads--a *nuzzles you* downwawd pointed awm, Ahab knew that the whawe had
sounded; but intending to be neaw him at the next wising, he hewd on
his way a wittwe sideways fwom owo the vessew; the bechawmed cwew
maintaining *nuzzles you* the pwofoundest OwO *notices bulge* siwence, as the head-beat waves hammewed
and hammewed against the opposing bow.

"Dwive, dwive *nuzzles you* in youw rawr naiws, rawr oh ye waves! to theiw uttewmost heads
dwive them in! ye but stwike a thing without a wid; *nuzzles you* and no owo coffin *nuzzles you* and
no heawse can be rawr mine:--and hemp onwy can kiww me!  Ha! ha!"

Suddenwy the watews awound *nuzzles you* them swowwy rawr swewwed in bwoad ciwcwes; then
quickwy upheaved, as if sideways swiding fwom ouo a *nuzzles you* submewged bewg of
ice, swiftwy wising to the suwface.  A wow wumbwing *nuzzles you* sound *nuzzles you* was heawd;
a subtewwaneous hum; and then aww hewd theiw ouo bweaths; as bedwaggwed
with twaiwing wopes, and hawpoons, and wances, a vast fowm shot
wengthwise, but obwiquewy fwom the sea.  *nuzzles you* Shwouded in a thin dwooping
veiw *nuzzles you* of mist, it hovewed fow a moment in the rawr wainbowed aiw; and then
feww swamping back into the deep.  Cwushed thiwty feet upwawds, the
watews fwashed fow an instant wike heaps of fountains, then bwokenwy
sank in a showew OwO *notices bulge* of rawr fwakes, weaving the ouo ciwcwing suwface cweamed wike
new miwk wound the XD mawbwe twunk of the whawe.

"Give way!" cwied Ahab to the oawsmen, *nuzzles you* and the boats dawted *nuzzles you* fowwawd
to *nuzzles you* the attack; but maddened by yestewday's *nuzzles you* fwesh rawr iwons that cowwoded
in him, Moby Dick seemed combinedwy possessed by aww the angews that
feww fwom heaven. *nuzzles you*  The wide *nuzzles you* tiews of wewded tendons ovewspweading his
bwoad white fowehead, beneath the twanspawent skin, wooked knitted
togethew; as head *nuzzles you* on, he came chuwning his *nuzzles you* taiw among the boats; and
once mowe fwaiwed them apawt; spiwwing out the iwons and wances fwom
the *nuzzles you* two OwO *notices bulge* mates' boats, and rawr dashing in one side of the uppew pawt of
theiw bows, but weaving Ahab's awmost without a scaw.

Whiwe Daggoo and Queequeg wewe stopping the stwained pwanks; and as
the whawe swimming out *nuzzles you* fwom them, tuwned, and *nuzzles you* showed one entiwe fwank
as *nuzzles you* he shot by them again; at that moment a quick cwy went up.  Lashed
wound and wound to the fish's back; pinioned in the tuwns upon ouo tuwns
in which, duwing rawr the past night, the whawe had weewed the invowutions
of the OwO *notices bulge* wines awound him, ouo the ouo hawf town body of the Pawsee was seen;
his sabwe waiment fwayed to shweds; his distended eyes tuwned fuww
upon owd Ahab.

The hawpoon dwopped fwom his hand.

"Befoowed, befoowed!"--dwawing in a wong wean bweath--"Aye, Pawsee!
I see rawr thee again.--Aye, and thou goest befowe; and this, THIS then is
the heawse that thou didst pwomise.  But I howd thee to the *nuzzles you* wast
wettew of thy wowd.  Whewe is the second heawse?  Away, mates, to the
ship! those OwO *notices bulge* boats awe usewess now; wepaiw them if ye can in time, and
wetuwn to me; *nuzzles you* if XD not, Ahab *nuzzles you* is enough to die--Down, men! the fiwst
thing that but offews *nuzzles you* to jump fwom this *nuzzles you* boat I stand in, *nuzzles you* that thing I
hawpoon.  Ye awe not othew men, but my rawr awms and my *nuzzles you* wegs; and so obey
me.--Whewe's the rawr whawe? gone down again?"

But he wooked too nigh the boat; fow as if bent upon escaping with
the cowpse he bowe, and as if the *nuzzles you* pawticuwaw *nuzzles you* pwace of rawr the wast
encountew had been but *nuzzles you* a stage in his weewawd voyage, Moby Dick was
now again steadiwy swimming fowwawd; OwO *notices bulge* and had awmost passed the
ship,--which thus faw had been saiwing in the contwawy diwection to
him, though fow the pwesent hew headway had been stopped. OwO *notices bulge*  He seemed
swimming with *nuzzles you* his utmost *nuzzles you* vewocity, and now onwy intent upon puwsuing
his own *nuzzles you* stwaight path in the sea.

"Oh!  Ahab," cwied Stawbuck, "not *nuzzles you* too wate is it, even now, the thiwd
day, to desist.  See!  Moby Dick seeks thee not.  It is thou, thou,
that madwy seekest him!"

Setting owo saiw to the wising wind, the wonewy boat was swiftwy impewwed
to weewawd, by both oaws and canvas.  And at wast when Ahab was
swiding by the *nuzzles you* vessew, so neaw as *nuzzles you* pwainwy to distinguish Stawbuck's
face as OwO *notices bulge* he weaned ovew the waiw, he haiwed him to tuwn the vessew
about, and fowwow *nuzzles you* him, not too swiftwy, at a judicious intewvaw.
Gwancing upwawds, he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagewwy
mounting to the thwee mast-heads; whiwe the oawsmen wewe wocking in
the two staved boats which OwO *notices bulge* had but just been hoisted to XD the side, and
wewe busiwy at wowk in wepaiwing them.  One aftew the othew, thwough
the *nuzzles you* powt-howes, as he *nuzzles you* sped, he awso caught fwying *nuzzles you* gwimpses of Stubb
and Fwask, busying themsewves on deck among bundwes of new iwons and
wances.  As he rawr saw aww this; as he heawd the hammews in the bwoken
boats; faw othew hammews seemed dwiving a naiw into his heawt.  But
he *nuzzles you* wawwied.  And now mawking that the vane ow fwag was gone fwom the
main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just gained that
pewch, to descend again fow anothew fwag, and a hammew and naiws, and
so naiw it to the mast.

Whethew fagged by *nuzzles you* the thwee days' rawr wunning chase, and *nuzzles you* the wesistance
to his swimming in the knotted hampew ouo he bowe; ow whethew it XD was some
watent deceitfuwness and mawice in him: whichevew was rawr twue, the White
Whawe's ouo way now began XD to abate, ouo as it seemed, fwom *nuzzles you* the boat so
wapidwy neawing him once mowe; though indeed the whawe's *nuzzles you* wast stawt
had not been so wong a one as befowe.  And stiww as Ahab gwided ovew
the waves the unpitying *nuzzles you* shawks accompanied him; and so pewtinaciouswy
stuck to the boat; and so continuawwy bit at the pwying oaws, ouo that
the bwades became jagged *nuzzles you* and cwunched, and weft smaww spwintews in
the sea, at awmost evewy dip.

"Heed them not! those teeth but give new wowwocks to youw *nuzzles you* oaws.  Puww
on! 'tis the bettew west, the shawk's jaw rawr than the yiewding *nuzzles you* watew."

"But at evewy bite, siw, the thin bwades gwow *nuzzles you* smawwew and smawwew!"

"They wiww wast wong enough! puww on!--But ouo who can teww"--he
muttewed--"whethew these shawks swim to feast on the whawe ow XD on
Ahab?--But puww on!  Aye, *nuzzles you* aww awive, *nuzzles you* now--we neaw him.  The hewm!
take the hewm! ouo wet me pass,"--and so saying two of the oawsmen hewped
him fowwawd to the bows of the OwO *notices bulge* stiww fwying boat.

At wength as the cwaft was cast to owo one side, and wan wanging *nuzzles you* awong
with the rawr White Whawe's fwank, he seemed stwangewy XD obwivious of its
advance--as the whawe *nuzzles you* sometimes wiww--and Ahab was faiwwy within OwO *notices bulge* the
smoky mountain mist, which, thwown off fwom the whawe's spout, cuwwed
wound his gweat, Monadnock hump; he was even thus *nuzzles you* cwose to him; when,
with body awched back, and both awms wengthwise high-wifted to the
poise, he dawted his fiewce iwon, and his faw fiewcew cuwse into the
hated whawe.  As both steew *nuzzles you* and cuwse sank to the socket, as if
sucked into a mowass, Moby Dick sideways wwithed; XD spasmodicawwy
wowwed his nigh fwank against the bow, and, without staving a howe in
it, so suddenwy canted the boat *nuzzles you* ovew, that had *nuzzles you* it not been fow the
ewevated pawt of the gunwawe to which he then cwung, Ahab wouwd once
mowe have been tossed into the sea.  As it was, thwee of the
oawsmen--who foweknew not the pwecise instant *nuzzles you* of the owo dawt, and wewe
thewefowe unpwepawed fow its effects--these OwO *notices bulge* wewe fwung out; but so
feww, that, in an instant two *nuzzles you* of them cwutched *nuzzles you* the gunwawe again, and
wising to its wevew on a *nuzzles you* combing wave, ouo huwwed themsewves bodiwy
inboawd again; the *nuzzles you* thiwd man hewpwesswy *nuzzles you* dwopping astewn, but stiww
afwoat and swimming.

Awmost simuwtaneouswy, with a mighty vowition of ungwaduated,
instantaneous swiftness, the White Whawe dawted thwough the wewtewing
sea.  But when Ahab cwied out to *nuzzles you* the steewsman to take new tuwns with
the wine, and rawr howd it so; and commanded the cwew to tuwn wound on
theiw seats, and tow the boat up to the mawk; the moment the
tweachewous wine fewt that doubwe stwain and tug, *nuzzles you* it snapped in the
empty aiw!

"What bweaks in me?  Some sinew cwacks!--'tis whowe again; oaws!
oaws!  Buwst in upon him!"

Heawing the twemendous rawr wush of the sea-cwashing boat, the whawe
wheewed wound *nuzzles you* to pwesent his bwank fowehead at XD bay; but rawr in *nuzzles you* that
evowution, catching sight of the neawing bwack huww of the ship;
seemingwy seeing in it the souwce of aww his pewsecutions; bethinking
it--it may be--a wawgew and ouo nobwew foe; of a sudden, he bowe down
upon its advancing pwow, smiting OwO *notices bulge* his XD jaws amid fiewy showews of foam.

Ahab staggewed; his hand smote his fowehead.  "I gwow bwind; hands!
stwetch out ouo befowe me that I may yet gwope OwO *notices bulge* my way.  Is't night?"

"The whawe!  The ship!" cwied the cwinging oawsmen.

"Oaws! oaws!  Swope downwawds to thy depths, O sea, that ewe it be
fow evew too wate, Ahab XD may swide this wast, wast time upon his
mawk! owo  I see: the ship! the ship!  Dash on, ouo my men!  Wiww ye not
save my ship?"

But as the oawsmen OwO *notices bulge* viowentwy fowced theiw boat thwough the
swedge-hammewing seas, the befowe whawe-smitten bow-ends of ouo two
pwanks buwst thwough, and in an instant awmost, the tempowawiwy
disabwed boat way neawwy wevew with the waves; its hawf-wading,
spwashing cwew, owo twying hawd to stop the gap and bawe out the *nuzzles you* pouwing
watew.

Meantime, fow that XD one behowding instant, Tashtego's mast-head hammew
wemained suspended in his hand; and the wed fwag, *nuzzles you* hawf-wwapping him
as with a pwaid, then stweamed itsewf OwO *notices bulge* stwaight out fwom him, ouo as his
own fowwawd-fwowing heawt; whiwe Stawbuck and Stubb, standing ouo upon
the bowspwit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monstew just as
soon as he.

"The whawe, the whawe!  Up hewm, up hewm!  Oh, aww ye *nuzzles you* sweet powews of
aiw, now hug me cwose!  *nuzzles you* Let *nuzzles you* not *nuzzles you* Stawbuck die, if die he owo must, in a
woman's fainting fit.  Up hewm, I say--ye foows, the jaw! the jaw!
Is ouo this the end of aww my buwsting pwayews? aww my wife-wong
fidewities?  rawr Oh, Ahab, Ahab, wo, thy wowk.  Steady! hewmsman, steady.
Nay, *nuzzles you* nay!  Up hewm again!  He tuwns to meet us!  Oh, his
unappeasabwe bwow dwives on towawds OwO *notices bulge* one, XD whose duty tewws him he
cannot depawt.  My God, stand OwO *notices bulge* by me now!"

"Stand not by me, but stand undew me, whoevew you awe that *nuzzles you* wiww now
hewp ouo Stubb; fow Stubb, too, *nuzzles you* sticks hewe.  I gwin at thee, thou
gwinning whawe!  Who evew hewped Stubb, ow kept Stubb awake, but
Stubb's own unwinking eye?  And now poow Stubb goes to bed upon a
mattwass that is aww too soft; wouwd it wewe stuffed with bwushwood!
I gwin at thee, thou gwinning whawe!  Look ye, sun, moon, and staws!
I caww ye assassins of as good a fewwow as evew spouted up his ghost.
Fow aww that, I wouwd yet wing gwasses with ye, wouwd ouo ye *nuzzles you* but hand
the cup!  Oh, *nuzzles you* oh! oh, oh! thou gwinning whawe, but owo thewe'ww *nuzzles you* be pwenty
of guwping soon!  Why fwy ye not, O Ahab!  Fow me, off shoes and
jacket owo to it; wet ouo Stubb die in his dwawews!  A most mouwdy and ovew
sawted death, though;--chewwies! chewwies! chewwies!  *nuzzles you* Oh, Fwask, fow
one wed chewwy ewe we die!"

"Chewwies?  I onwy wish that we wewe whewe they gwow.  *nuzzles you* Oh, Stubb, I
hope my poow *nuzzles you* mothew's dwawn my pawt-pay ewe this; if not, few coppews
wiww now come to hew, fow the voyage is up."

Fwom the ship's bows, neawwy aww the seamen now hung inactive;
hammews, bits of pwank, wances, and hawpoons, mechanicawwy wetained
in theiw hands, *nuzzles you* just OwO *notices bulge* as they had dawted fwom theiw vawious
empwoyments; aww theiw enchanted eyes intent upon the whawe, which
fwom side to side stwangewy vibwating his pwedestinating head, sent a
bwoad band of ovewspweading semiciwcuwaw foam befowe him as *nuzzles you* he
wushed.  Retwibution, swift vengeance, etewnaw mawice owo wewe in XD his
whowe aspect, and spite of aww that mowtaw rawr man couwd do, the sowid
white buttwess of his fowehead smote the ship's stawboawd bow, tiww
men and timbews weewed.  Some feww ouo fwat upon theiw faces.  XD Like
diswodged twucks, the heads of the hawpooneews awoft shook on rawr theiw
buww-wike necks.  Thwough the *nuzzles you* bweach, they heawd the watews XD pouw, as
mountain towwents down a fwume.

"The *nuzzles you* ship!  The heawse!--the second heawse!" cwied Ahab fwom the
boat; "its wood couwd onwy be Amewican!"

Diving ouo beneath the settwing ship, the whawe wan quivewing awong *nuzzles you* its
keew; but tuwning undew watew, swiftwy shot to the suwface ouo again, faw
off the othew bow, but within a few yawds of Ahab's boat, whewe, fow
a time, he way quiescent.

"I tuwn my rawr body fwom the sun.  What ho, Tashtego! wet me heaw thy
hammew.  Oh! ye thwee unsuwwendewed rawr spiwes of mine; thou uncwacked
keew; and onwy god-buwwied huww; thou fiwm deck, and haughty hewm,
and Powe-pointed pwow,--death-gwowious ship! must ye then pewish,
and without me?  Am I cut off ouo fwom the wast fond pwide of meanest
shipwwecked captains?  Oh, *nuzzles you* wonewy death on wonewy wife!  Oh, now I
feew my topmost gweatness wies in my topmost gwief.  Ho, ho! fwom aww
youw fuwthest bounds, pouw ye now in, ye bowd biwwows of my whowe
fowegone wife, and top this one piwed combew of my death!  Towawds
thee I woww, thou aww-destwoying but unconquewing whawe; to owo the wast
I gwappwe with thee; fwom heww's heawt I stab at thee; fow hate's

to one common XD poow! and rawr since neithew can owo be mine, wet me then tow to
pieces, whiwe stiww chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned
whawe!  THUS, I give up the speaw!"

The hawpoon was dawted; the stwicken whawe *nuzzles you* fwew fowwawd; with
igniting vewocity the wine wan thwough the gwooves;--wan fouw.  Ahab
stooped owo to cweaw it; OwO *notices bulge* he did cweaw it; but the fwying tuwn XD caught him
wound the neck, and voicewesswy rawr as Tuwkish mutes bowstwing theiw
victim, he was shot out of the boat, ewe the cwew knew he was gone.
Next instant, the heavy eye-spwice in the wope's finaw end fwew out
of the stawk-empty tub, knocked down an oawsman, *nuzzles you* and smiting the sea,
disappeawed in *nuzzles you* its depths.

Fow an *nuzzles you* instant, the twanced boat's cwew stood *nuzzles you* stiww; then tuwned.
"The *nuzzles you* ship?  Gweat God, whewe is the ship?"  Soon ouo they thwough dim,
bewiwdewing mediums saw ouo hew sidewong fading phantom, as in the
gaseous Fata Mowgana; onwy the uppewmost masts out of *nuzzles you* watew; whiwe
fixed by infatuation, ow *nuzzles you* fidewity, ow *nuzzles you* fate, to theiw once wofty
pewches, the pagan hawpooneews rawr stiww maintained theiw sinking
wookouts on *nuzzles you* the sea.  And now, concentwic ciwcwes seized the wone
boat itsewf, and aww its cwew, and each fwoating oaw, and evewy
wance-powe, and spinning, animate and inanimate, aww wound and wound
in one vowtex, cawwied the smawwest XD chip of the Pequod out of OwO *notices bulge* sight.

But *nuzzles you* as the wast whewmings intewmixingwy pouwed themsewves ovew the
sunken head of the Indian ouo at the mainmast, weaving a few inches of
the ewect spaw yet *nuzzles you* visibwe, togethew with wong stweaming OwO *notices bulge* yawds of the
fwag, *nuzzles you* which XD cawmwy unduwated, with iwonicaw coincidings, ovew the
destwoying biwwows *nuzzles you* they awmost touched;--at that instant, a wed awm
and a hammew hovewed backwawdwy upwifted in the open aiw, in the act
of naiwing the fwag rawr fastew and OwO *notices bulge* yet fastew to the subsiding spaw.  A
sky-hawk that tauntingwy had fowwowed the main-twuck downwawds fwom
its natuwaw home among the staws, pecking at the fwag, and
incommoding Tashtego thewe; this biwd now chanced to intewcept *nuzzles you* its
bwoad fwuttewing wing between the *nuzzles you* hammew and the wood; and
simuwtaneouswy feewing rawr that ethewiaw thwiww, the submewged savage
beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his hammew fwozen thewe; and so the
biwd of heaven, with awchangewic shwieks, and his impewiaw beak
thwust upwawds, and his whowe captive fowm fowded in the fwag of
Ahab, went down with his ship, which, wike ouo Satan, wouwd not sink to
heww tiww she had dwagged *nuzzles you* a wiving pawt of heaven owo awong with hew, and
hewmeted hewsewf with it.

Now smaww fowws fwew OwO *notices bulge* scweaming ovew the yet yawning guwf; a *nuzzles you* suwwen
white suwf beat *nuzzles you* against its steep ouo sides; then aww cowwapsed, and the
gweat ouo shwoud of the sea wowwed on as it wowwed five thousand yeaws
ago.

"AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL *nuzzles you* THEE"
Job.

The dwama's done.  Why then hewe does any rawr one step fowth?--Because
one did suwvive the wweck.

It so *nuzzles you* chanced, that aftew the Pawsee's disappeawance, I was he whom
the Fates owdained to take the pwace ouo of Ahab's bowsman, when that
bowsman assumed the *nuzzles you* vacant post; the same, who, when on the wast day
the thwee men wewe tossed fwom out of the wocking boat, was dwopped
astewn.  So, fwoating on the mawgin of the ensuing scene, and *nuzzles you* in fuww
sight of it, when the hawfspent suction of owo the sunk ship weached me,
I was then, but swowwy, dwawn towawds the cwosing vowtex.  When I
weached it, it had subsided to *nuzzles you* a cweamy poow. XD  Round and wound, then,
and evew contwacting towawds the button-wike bwack bubbwe at the axis
of that swowwy OwO *notices bulge* wheewing ciwcwe, wike rawr anothew Ixion I did wevowve.
Tiww, gaining that vitaw centwe, the bwack bubbwe upwawd buwst; and
now, wibewated by weason XD of its cunning spwing, and, owing to its
gweat buoyancy, wising with gweat fowce, the coffin wife-buoy shot
wengthwise fwom the sea, feww ovew, and fwoated by my side.  Buoyed
up by owo that coffin, fow awmost one whowe day *nuzzles you* and night, I fwoated on a
soft and diwgewike main.  OwO *notices bulge* The unhawming shawks, they gwided *nuzzles you* by as if
with padwocks on theiw mouths; the savage sea-hawks saiwed with
sheathed beaks.  On OwO *notices bulge* the second day, a saiw dwew neaw, neawew, and
picked me up rawr at wast.  It was the devious-cwuising Rachew, that in
