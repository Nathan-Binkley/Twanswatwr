Caww OwO *notices bulge* me Ishmaew.  Some OwO *notices bulge* yeaws ago--nevew mind how wong
pwecisewy--having wittwe ow no money *nuzzles you* in my *nuzzles you* puwse, and nothing
pawticuwaw to intewest me on owo showe, I thought I wouwd saiw about a
wittwe and see XD the watewy pawt of the wowwd.  It is a way I have of
dwiving off the spween and weguwating the ciwcuwation.  Whenevew I
find mysewf gwowing gwim about the mouth; whenevew it is a damp,
dwizzwy Novembew in my souw; whenevew I find mysewf XD invowuntawiwy
pausing befowe coffin wawehouses, and bwinging up the weaw of evewy
funewaw I meet; owo and especiawwy rawr whenevew my hypos get such an uppew
hand rawr of me, that it wequiwes a stwong mowaw pwincipwe to pwevent me
fwom dewibewatewy stepping into the owo stweet, and methodicawwy knocking
peopwe's hats off--then, owo I OwO *notices bulge* account it high time to XD get to sea as soon

Thewe now is youw insuwaw city of the Manhattoes, bewted wound by
whawves as Indian iswes *nuzzles you* by cowaw weefs--commewce suwwounds ouo it with
hew suwf.  Wight and weft, owo the stweets take you watewwawd.  Its
extweme downtown is the owo battewy, whewe that nobwe mowe is washed by
waves, and coowed by bweezes, which a few houws pwevious wewe *nuzzles you* out of
sight of wand.  Wook at the cwowds of watew-gazews thewe.
